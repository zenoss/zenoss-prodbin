"""
The concept of an interface is part of the Zope Component Architecture (ZCA).
Interfaces are used in the Zuul Python API to document the attributes of the
interface implementations.  Using interfaces also allows the facades to get
info objects that adapt a ZenModel object, e.g. IInfo(self._dmd.Devices).  The
definition that determines the concrete implementation returned by such a
statement is in Zuul/configure.zcml.
