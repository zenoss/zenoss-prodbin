        Correlate ping down events.
        
        This simple correlator will take a list of PingTasks and filters out
        up tasks. It loops through the list and the last known trace route
        for each of the ip's. For every hop in the traceroute (starting from the
        collector to the ip in question), the hop's ip is searched for in
        downTasks. If it's found, then this collector was also monitoring the
        source of the problem.
        
        Note: this does not take in to account multiple routes to the ip in
        question. It uses only the last known traceroute as given by nmap which
        will not have routing loops and hosts that block icmp.
