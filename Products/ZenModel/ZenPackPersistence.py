    This is a mix-in class that should be used whenever a ZenPack-supplied
    class is going to be stored persistently in the zodb.  It provides
    for a catalog to associate objects in zodb with the ZenPacks that provide
    those objects' classes.
    
    The motivation for this is that we usually need to delete all instances
    of zenpack-supplied classes when that zenpack is deleted.  This is
    because the class for those objects no longer exists and they are just
    sad, broken, unloved objects in the zodb at that point.  This is 
    undesirable.
    
    IMPORTANT: This should be the first class listed in any subclasses's
    list of parents.  Otherwise the manage_* methods of the other classes
    will likely be called and these skipped.
