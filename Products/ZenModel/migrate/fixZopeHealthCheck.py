In 5.0, the 'ready' healthcheck for the tenant application expected the HTML
returned for a 401 error to contain the word 'zope', which happened to be
included in the stacktrace output returned by Zope in the HTML page for 401
errors. The stacktrace was removed as part of cleaning up a security bug in
Zope, and that broke the healthcheck.

This script updates the 'ready' healthcheck for tenant apps so that it just
checks the HTTP status code. Presumably, if Zope can respond to an
unauthenticated request with a 401, it is ready to accept other requests.
