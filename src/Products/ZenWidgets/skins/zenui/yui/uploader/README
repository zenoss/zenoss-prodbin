YUI Library - Uploader - Release Notes

2.6.0
  * Changes due to new security rules in Flash Player 10:
     * Browse() function has been eliminated; the uploader now has to have an internal Flash UI.
     * The Uploader can be rendered as a transparent Flash layer, or as a skinned button.
     * Mouse events on the Uploader are exposed to JavaScript.

  * Known issues:
	 * The intended behavior of the uploader is not to send any cookies with its requests. Due to a limitation 
	   of the Windows networking library, when running in IE, the uploader sends the cookies with the upload.
	   However, you cannot rely on this behavior for authentication, because it's absent in other browsers. 
	   As a workaround, we suggest either using a cookieless upload method or appending document.cookie
	   to the upload request.
	 * There are some known issues around keyboard interaction with the uploader. In particular, when the 
	   uploader is rendered as a transparent layer, it does not respond to keyboard presses - only mouse
	   functionality is available. When the uploader is rendered as an image, it receives "Space" and "Enter" 
	   key presses as triggers, but only if the focus is on the uploader component itself. Keyboard tabbing 
	   to the component behaves differently in different browsers.
	 * Because of Flash limitations, the uploader does not support basic authentication.
	 * Because of Flash limitations, the uploader behavior when working through a proxy server is inconsistent 
	   and unreliable.
     * When uploading to HTTPS servers, be aware that Flash does not support self-signed certificates. You 
       would need to obtain certificates from a recognized certificate authority.

2.5.1
  * Fix to ensure UploadCancel fires when expected.
