How to Make a New Class

- If you are going to subclass something copy its "Classification" Class
to the name of your new Class.  Also copy the "Instance" Class of the old 
class to the new Instance class.  To sub class device:

cp DeviceClass.py NewSubDevuceClass.py
cp Device.py NewSubDevice.py


- Replace all occurences of "Name" with your new Name in both files. 

s/Device/NewSubDevice/g

- Check the name of the manage_add factory function at the top of the file.  It didn't get changed I bet.

- cd to the dtml directory and copy the add files for the "Classification"
and "Instance" classes.  Then sed these files as shown above as well.

- edit the __init__.py file in the Confmon module so that it will load the new
  classes.


- make some new icons for your type (try copying one that exists already)

- do you need to modify DmdBuilder so that you get a Classification object
  added?

- check to see if you need to remove functions/attributes that you just
want to inherit.  add the new behavior by overriding functions/attributes
in the new class.

- test out the new classes in the ZMI by adding a classification and instance
  to there proper place in the DMD
