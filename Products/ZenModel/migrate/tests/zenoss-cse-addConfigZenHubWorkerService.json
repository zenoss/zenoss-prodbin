Writing against\n# a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data\n# written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but\n# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a\n# misconfiguration.\n#\n# Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.\n#\n# Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients\n# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.\n# Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands\n# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extend you can improve\n# security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the\n# administrative / dangerous commands.\nslave-read-only yes\n\n# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change\n# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10\n# seconds.\n#\n# repl-ping-slave-period 10\n\n# The following option sets a timeout for both Bulk transfer I/O timeout and\n# master data or ping response timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.\n#\n# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value\n# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected\n# every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.\n#\n# repl-timeout 60\n\n# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?\n#\n# If you select \"yes\" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and\n# less bandwidth to send data to slaves.

By default\n# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not\n# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit\n# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit\n# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).\n#\n# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending\n# an error 'max number of clients reached'.\n#\n# maxclients 10000\n\n# Don't use more memory than the specified amount of bytes.\n# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys\n# accordingly to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemmory-policy).\n#\n# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is\n# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands\n# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue\n# to reply to read-only commands like GET.\n#\n# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU cache, or to set\n# an hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).\n#\n# WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,\n# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted\n# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will\n# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output\n# buffer of slaves is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion\n# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.\n#\n# In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower\n# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for slave\n# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').\n#\nmaxmemory {{percentScale .RAMCommitment 0.9}}\n\n# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory\n# is reached.

This mode is\n# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or\n# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on\n# the configured save points).\n#\n# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides\n# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy\n# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a\n# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something\n# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is\n# still running correctly.\n#\n# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.\n# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file\n# with the better durability guarantees.\n#\n# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.\n\nappendonly no\n\n# The name of the append only file (default: \"appendonly.aof\")\n# appendfilename appendonly.aof\n\n# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk\n# instead to wait for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush \n# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.\n#\n# Redis supports three different modes:\n#\n# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.\n# always: fsync after every write to the append only log . Slow, Safest.\n# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.\n#\n# The default is \"everysec\", as that's usually the right compromise between\n# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to\n# \"no\" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when\n# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of\n# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),\n# or on the contrary, use \"always\" that's very slow but a bit safer than\n# everysec.\n#\n# More details please check the following article:\n# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html\n#\n# If unsure, use \"everysec\".\n\n# appendfsync always\nappendfsync everysec\n# appendfsync no\n\n# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background\n# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is\n# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations\n# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for\n# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block\n# our synchronous write(2) call.\n#\n# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option\n# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a\n# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.\n#\n# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is\n# the same as \"appendfsync none\". In practical terms, this means that it is\n# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the\n# default Linux settings).\n# \n# If you have latency problems turn this to \"yes\". Otherwise leave it as\n# \"no\" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.\nno-appendfsync-on-rewrite no\n\n# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.\n# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling\n# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.\n# \n# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the\n# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of\n# the AOF at startup is used).\n#\n# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is\n# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also\n# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this\n# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase\n# is reached but it is still pretty small.\n#\n# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF\n# rewrite feature.\n\nauto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100\nauto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb\n\n################################ LUA SCRIPTING  ###############################\n\n# Max execution time of a Lua script in milliseconds.\n#\n# If the maximum execution time is reached Redis will log that a script is\n# still in execution after the maximum allowed time and will start to\n# reply to queries with an error.\n#\n# When a long running script exceed the maximum execution time only the\n# SCRIPT KILL and SHUTDOWN NOSAVE commands are available.

When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the\n# queue of logged commands.\n\n# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent\n# to one second.

Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of\n# another Redis server. Note that the configuration is local to the slave\n# so for example it is possible to configure the slave to save the DB with a\n# different interval, or to listen to another port, and so on.\n#\n# slaveof <masterip> <masterport>\n\n# If the master is password protected (using the \"requirepass\" configuration\n# directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before\n# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will\n# refuse the slave request.\n#\n# masterauth <master-password>\n\n# When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication\n# is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:\n#\n# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will\n#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the\n#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.\n#\n# 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with\n#    an error \"SYNC with master in progress\" to all the kind of commands\n#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.\n#\nslave-serve-stale-data yes\n\n# You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against\n# a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data\n# written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but\n# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a\n# misconfiguration.\n#\n# Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.\n#\n# Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients\n# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.\n# Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands\n# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extend you can improve\n# security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the\n# administrative / dangerous commands.\nslave-read-only yes\n\n# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change\n# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10\n# seconds.\n#\n# repl-ping-slave-period 10\n\n# The following option sets a timeout for both Bulk transfer I/O timeout and\n# master data or ping response timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.\n#\n# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value\n# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected\n# every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.\n#\n# repl-timeout 60\n\n# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?\n#\n# If you select \"yes\" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and\n# less bandwidth to send data to slaves. But this can add a delay for\n# the data to appear on the slave side, up to 40 milliseconds with\n# Linux kernels using a default configuration.\n#\n# If you select \"no\" the delay for data to appear on the slave side will\n# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.\n#\n# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions\n# or when the master and slaves are many hops away, turning this to \"yes\" may\n# be a good idea.\nrepl-disable-tcp-nodelay no\n\n# The slave priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.\n# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a slave to promote into a\n# master if the master is no longer working correctly.\n#\n# A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so\n# for instance if there are three slaves with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will\n# pick the one wtih priority 10, that is the lowest.\n#\n# However a special priority of 0 marks the slave as not able to perform the\n# role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by\n# Redis Sentinel for promotion.\n#\n# By default the priority is 100.\nslave-priority 100\n\n################################## SECURITY ###################################\n\n# Require clients to issue AUTH <PASSWORD> before processing any other\n# commands.  This might be useful in environments in which you do not trust\n# others with access to the host running redis-server.\n#\n# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most\n# people do not need auth (e.g. they run their own servers).\n# \n# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to\n# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should\n# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.\n#\n# requirepass foobared\n\n# Command renaming.\n#\n# It is possible to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared\n# environment. For instance the CONFIG command may be renamed into something\n# hard to guess so that it will still be available for internal-use tools\n# but not available for general clients.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52\n#\n# It is also possible to completely kill a command by renaming it into\n# an empty string:\n#\n# rename-command CONFIG \"\"\n#\n# Please note that changing the name of commands that are logged into the\n# AOF file or transmitted to slaves may cause problems.\n\n################################### LIMITS ####################################\n\n# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default\n# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not\n# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit\n# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit\n# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).\n#\n# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending\n# an error 'max number of clients reached'.\n#\n# maxclients 10000\n\n# Don't use more memory than the specified amount of bytes.\n# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys\n# accordingly to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemmory-policy).\n#\n# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is\n# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands\n# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue\n# to reply to read-only commands like GET.\n#\n# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU cache, or to set\n# an hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).\n#\n# WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,\n# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted\n# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will\n# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output\n# buffer of slaves is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion\n# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.\n#\n# In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower\n# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for slave\n# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').\n#\nmaxmemory {{percentScale .RAMCommitment 0.9}}\n\n# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory\n# is reached. You can select among five behaviors:\n# \n# volatile-lru -> remove the key with an expire set using an LRU algorithm\n# allkeys-lru -> remove any key accordingly to the LRU algorithm\n# volatile-random -> remove a random key with an expire set\n# allkeys-random -> remove a random key, any key\n# volatile-ttl -> remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)\n# noeviction -> don't expire at all, just return an error on write operations\n# \n# Note: with any of the above policies, Redis will return an error on write\n#       operations, when there are not suitable keys for eviction.\n#\n#       At the date of writing this commands are: set setnx setex append\n#       incr decr rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd\n#       sinter sinterstore sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby\n#       zunionstore zinterstore hset hsetnx hmset hincrby incrby decrby\n#       getset mset msetnx exec sort\n#\n# The default is:\n#\n# maxmemory-policy volatile-lru\n\n# LRU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated\n# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can select as well the sample\n# size to check. For instance for default Redis will check three keys and\n# pick the one that was used less recently, you can change the sample size\n# using the following configuration directive.\n#\n# maxmemory-samples 3\n\n############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################\n\n# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is\n# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or\n# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on\n# the configured save points).\n#\n# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides\n# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy\n# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a\n# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something\n# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is\n# still running correctly.\n#\n# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.\n# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file\n# with the better durability guarantees.\n#\n# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.\n\nappendonly no\n\n# The name of the append only file (default: \"appendonly.aof\")\n# appendfilename appendonly.aof\n\n# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk\n# instead to wait for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush \n# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.\n#\n# Redis supports three different modes:\n#\n# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.\n# always: fsync after every write to the append only log . Slow, Safest.\n# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.\n#\n# The default is \"everysec\", as that's usually the right compromise between\n# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to\n# \"no\" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when\n# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of\n# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),\n# or on the contrary, use \"always\" that's very slow but a bit safer than\n# everysec.\n#\n# More details please check the following article:\n# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html\n#\n# If unsure, use \"everysec\".\n\n# appendfsync always\nappendfsync everysec\n# appendfsync no\n\n# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background\n# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is\n# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations\n# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for\n# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block\n# our synchronous write(2) call.\n#\n# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option\n# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a\n# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.\n#\n# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is\n# the same as \"appendfsync none\". In practical terms, this means that it is\n# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the\n# default Linux settings).\n# \n# If you have latency problems turn this to \"yes\". Otherwise leave it as\n# \"no\" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.\nno-appendfsync-on-rewrite no\n\n# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.\n# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling\n# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.\n# \n# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the\n# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of\n# the AOF at startup is used).\n#\n# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is\n# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also\n# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this\n# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase\n# is reached but it is still pretty small.\n#\n# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF\n# rewrite feature.\n\nauto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100\nauto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb\n\n################################ LUA SCRIPTING  ###############################\n\n# Max execution time of a Lua script in milliseconds.\n#\n# If the maximum execution time is reached Redis will log that a script is\n# still in execution after the maximum allowed time and will start to\n# reply to queries with an error.\n#\n# When a long running script exceed the maximum execution time only the\n# SCRIPT KILL and SHUTDOWN NOSAVE commands are available. The first can be\n# used to stop a script that did not yet called write commands. The second\n# is the only way to shut down the server in the case a write commands was\n# already issue by the script but the user don't want to wait for the natural\n# termination of the script.\n#\n# Set it to 0 or a negative value for unlimited execution without warnings.\nlua-time-limit 5000\n\n################################## SLOW LOG ###################################\n\n# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified\n# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations\n# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,\n# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only\n# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve\n# other requests in the meantime).\n# \n# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis\n# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the\n# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the\n# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the\n# queue of logged commands.\n\n# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent\n# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while\n# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.\nslowlog-log-slower-than 10000\n\n# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.\n# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.\nslowlog-max-len 128\n\n############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################\n\n# Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a\n# small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given\n# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.\nhash-max-ziplist-entries 512\nhash-max-ziplist-value 64\n\n# Similarly to hashes, small lists are also encoded in a special way in order\n# to save a lot of space. The special representation is only used when\n# you are under the following limits:\nlist-max-ziplist-entries 512\nlist-max-ziplist-value 64\n\n# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed\n# of just strings that happens to be integers in radix 10 in the range\n# of 64 bit signed integers.\n# The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the\n# set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.\nset-max-intset-entries 512\n\n# Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in\n# order to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and\n# elements of a sorted set are below the following limits:\nzset-max-ziplist-entries 128\nzset-max-ziplist-value 64\n\n# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in\n# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level\n# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)\n# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into an hash table\n# that is rehashing, the more rehashing \"steps\" are performed, so if the\n# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used\n# by the hash table.\n# \n# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to\n# active rehashing the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.\n#\n# If unsure:\n# use \"activerehashing no\" if you have hard latency requirements and it is\n# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply form time to time\n# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.\n#\n# use \"activerehashing yes\" if you don't have such hard requirements but\n# want to free memory asap when possible.\nactiverehashing yes\n\n# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients\n# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a\n# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the\n# publisher can produce them).\n#\n# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:\n#\n# normal -> normal clients\n# slave  -> slave clients and MONITOR clients\n# pubsub -> clients subcribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern\n#\n# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:\n#\n# client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>\n#\n# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if\n# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of\n# seconds (continuously).\n# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is\n# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately\n# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get\n# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes\n# the limit for 10 seconds.\n#\n# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data\n# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only\n# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster\n# than it can read.\n#\n# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and slave clients, since\n# subscribers and slaves receive data in a push fashion.\n#\n# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.\nclient-output-buffer-limit normal 0 0 0\nclient-output-buffer-limit slave 256mb 64mb 60\nclient-output-buffer-limit pubsub 32mb 8mb 60\n\n# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like\n# closing connections of clients in timeot, purging expired keys that are\n# never requested, and so forth.\n#\n# Not all tasks are perforemd with the same frequency, but Redis checks for\n# tasks to perform accordingly to the specified \"hz\" value.\n#\n# By default \"hz\" is set to 10.

Non-persistent messages are MUCH faster\n## and do not use up disk space if a queue backs up.\n##\n## Possible values:\n##   1 -- do not persist\n##   2 -- persist\n##\n\n# Default is to have all messages persist to disk\n#exchange.default.delivery_mode = 2\n\n\n## Message Compression\n##\n## You can configure whether messages published to a given exchange should be\n## compressed.\n##\n## Possible values:\n##   deflate -- use DEFLATE algorithm\n##   none -- do not compress messages\n##\n\n# Default is to compress messages published to all exchanges\n#exchange.default.compression = deflate\n\n\n## Message TTL (time to live)\n##\n## You can configure messages published to a queue to expire if they have not\n## been delivered to a client within a given time. Value is in milliseconds.\n\n# Default is to have messages expire after a day\n#queue.default.x-message-ttl = 86400000\n\n\n## Queue Expiration\n##\n## You can configure unused queues to be deleted automatically after a period\n## of time. \"Unused\" means that the queue has no consumers and has not been\n## redeclared. Value is in milliseconds.\n\n# Default is to have queues expire after a day\n#queue.default.x-expires = 86400000\n\n",

Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of\n# another Redis server. Note that the configuration is local to the slave\n# so for example it is possible to configure the slave to save the DB with a\n# different interval, or to listen to another port, and so on.\n#\n# slaveof <masterip> <masterport>\n\n# If the master is password protected (using the \"requirepass\" configuration\n# directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before\n# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will\n# refuse the slave request.\n#\n# masterauth <master-password>\n\n# When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication\n# is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:\n#\n# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will\n#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the\n#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.\n#\n# 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with\n#    an error \"SYNC with master in progress\" to all the kind of commands\n#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.\n#\nslave-serve-stale-data yes\n\n# You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against\n# a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data\n# written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but\n# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a\n# misconfiguration.\n#\n# Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.\n#\n# Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients\n# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.\n# Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands\n# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extend you can improve\n# security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the\n# administrative / dangerous commands.\nslave-read-only yes\n\n# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change\n# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10\n# seconds.\n#\n# repl-ping-slave-period 10\n\n# The following option sets a timeout for both Bulk transfer I/O timeout and\n# master data or ping response timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.\n#\n# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value\n# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected\n# every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.\n#\n# repl-timeout 60\n\n# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?\n#\n# If you select \"yes\" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and\n# less bandwidth to send data to slaves. But this can add a delay for\n# the data to appear on the slave side, up to 40 milliseconds with\n# Linux kernels using a default configuration.\n#\n# If you select \"no\" the delay for data to appear on the slave side will\n# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.\n#\n# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions\n# or when the master and slaves are many hops away, turning this to \"yes\" may\n# be a good idea.\nrepl-disable-tcp-nodelay no\n\n# The slave priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.\n# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a slave to promote into a\n# master if the master is no longer working correctly.\n#\n# A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so\n# for instance if there are three slaves with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will\n# pick the one wtih priority 10, that is the lowest.\n#\n# However a special priority of 0 marks the slave as not able to perform the\n# role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by\n# Redis Sentinel for promotion.\n#\n# By default the priority is 100.\nslave-priority 100\n\n################################## SECURITY ###################################\n\n# Require clients to issue AUTH <PASSWORD> before processing any other\n# commands.  This might be useful in environments in which you do not trust\n# others with access to the host running redis-server.\n#\n# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most\n# people do not need auth (e.g. they run their own servers).\n# \n# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to\n# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should\n# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.\n#\n# requirepass foobared\n\n# Command renaming.\n#\n# It is possible to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared\n# environment. For instance the CONFIG command may be renamed into something\n# hard to guess so that it will still be available for internal-use tools\n# but not available for general clients.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52\n#\n# It is also possible to completely kill a command by renaming it into\n# an empty string:\n#\n# rename-command CONFIG \"\"\n#\n# Please note that changing the name of commands that are logged into the\n# AOF file or transmitted to slaves may cause problems.\n\n################################### LIMITS ####################################\n\n# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time.

This mode is\n# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or\n# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on\n# the configured save points).\n#\n# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides\n# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy\n# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a\n# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something\n# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is\n# still running correctly.\n#\n# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.\n# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file\n# with the better durability guarantees.\n#\n# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.\n\nappendonly no\n\n# The name of the append only file (default: \"appendonly.aof\")\n# appendfilename appendonly.aof\n\n# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk\n# instead to wait for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush \n# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.\n#\n# Redis supports three different modes:\n#\n# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.\n# always: fsync after every write to the append only log . Slow, Safest.\n# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.\n#\n# The default is \"everysec\", as that's usually the right compromise between\n# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to\n# \"no\" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when\n# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of\n# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),\n# or on the contrary, use \"always\" that's very slow but a bit safer than\n# everysec.\n#\n# More details please check the following article:\n# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html\n#\n# If unsure, use \"everysec\".\n\n# appendfsync always\nappendfsync everysec\n# appendfsync no\n\n# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background\n# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is\n# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations\n# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for\n# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block\n# our synchronous write(2) call.\n#\n# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option\n# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a\n# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.\n#\n# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is\n# the same as \"appendfsync none\". In practical terms, this means that it is\n# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the\n# default Linux settings).\n# \n# If you have latency problems turn this to \"yes\". Otherwise leave it as\n# \"no\" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.\nno-appendfsync-on-rewrite no\n\n# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.\n# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling\n# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.\n# \n# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the\n# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of\n# the AOF at startup is used).\n#\n# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is\n# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also\n# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this\n# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase\n# is reached but it is still pretty small.\n#\n# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF\n# rewrite feature.\n\nauto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100\nauto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb\n\n################################ LUA SCRIPTING  ###############################\n\n# Max execution time of a Lua script in milliseconds.\n#\n# If the maximum execution time is reached Redis will log that a script is\n# still in execution after the maximum allowed time and will start to\n# reply to queries with an error.\n#\n# When a long running script exceed the maximum execution time only the\n# SCRIPT KILL and SHUTDOWN NOSAVE commands are available. The first can be\n# used to stop a script that did not yet called write commands.

The execution time does not include the I/O operations\n# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,\n# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only\n# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve\n# other requests in the meantime).\n# \n# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis\n# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the\n# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the\n# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the\n# queue of logged commands.\n\n# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent\n# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while\n# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.\nslowlog-log-slower-than 10000\n\n# There is no limit to this length.

Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of\n# another Redis server. Note that the configuration is local to the slave\n# so for example it is possible to configure the slave to save the DB with a\n# different interval, or to listen to another port, and so on.\n#\n# slaveof <masterip> <masterport>\n\n# If the master is password protected (using the \"requirepass\" configuration\n# directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before\n# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will\n# refuse the slave request.\n#\n# masterauth <master-password>\n\n# When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication\n# is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:\n#\n# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will\n#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the\n#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.\n#\n# 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with\n#    an error \"SYNC with master in progress\" to all the kind of commands\n#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.\n#\nslave-serve-stale-data yes\n\n# You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against\n# a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data\n# written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but\n# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a\n# misconfiguration.\n#\n# Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.\n#\n# Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients\n# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.\n# Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands\n# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extend you can improve\n# security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the\n# administrative / dangerous commands.\nslave-read-only yes\n\n# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change\n# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10\n# seconds.\n#\n# repl-ping-slave-period 10\n\n# The following option sets a timeout for both Bulk transfer I/O timeout and\n# master data or ping response timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.\n#\n# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value\n# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected\n# every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.\n#\n# repl-timeout 60\n\n# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?\n#\n# If you select \"yes\" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and\n# less bandwidth to send data to slaves.

For instance the CONFIG command may be renamed into something\n# hard to guess so that it will still be available for internal-use tools\n# but not available for general clients.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52\n#\n# It is also possible to completely kill a command by renaming it into\n# an empty string:\n#\n# rename-command CONFIG \"\"\n#\n# Please note that changing the name of commands that are logged into the\n# AOF file or transmitted to slaves may cause problems.\n\n################################### LIMITS ####################################\n\n# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default\n# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not\n# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit\n# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit\n# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).\n#\n# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending\n# an error 'max number of clients reached'.\n#\n# maxclients 10000\n\n# Don't use more memory than the specified amount of bytes.\n# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys\n# accordingly to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemmory-policy).\n#\n# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is\n# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands\n# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue\n# to reply to read-only commands like GET.\n#\n# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU cache, or to set\n# an hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).\n#\n# WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,\n# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted\n# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will\n# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output\n# buffer of slaves is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion\n# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.\n#\n# In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower\n# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for slave\n# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').\n#\nmaxmemory {{bytesToMB .RAMCommitment}}mb\n\n# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory\n# is reached.

For instance for default Redis will check three keys and\n# pick the one that was used less recently, you can change the sample size\n# using the following configuration directive.\n#\n# maxmemory-samples 3\n\n############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################\n\n# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is\n# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or\n# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on\n# the configured save points).\n#\n# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides\n# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy\n# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a\n# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something\n# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is\n# still running correctly.\n#\n# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.\n# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file\n# with the better durability guarantees.\n#\n# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.\n\nappendonly no\n\n# The name of the append only file (default: \"appendonly.aof\")\n# appendfilename appendonly.aof\n\n# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk\n# instead to wait for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush \n# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.\n#\n# Redis supports three different modes:\n#\n# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.\n# always: fsync after every write to the append only log . Slow, Safest.\n# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.\n#\n# The default is \"everysec\", as that's usually the right compromise between\n# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to\n# \"no\" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when\n# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of\n# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),\n# or on the contrary, use \"always\" that's very slow but a bit safer than\n# everysec.\n#\n# More details please check the following article:\n# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html\n#\n# If unsure, use \"everysec\".\n\n# appendfsync always\nappendfsync everysec\n# appendfsync no\n\n# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background\n# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is\n# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations\n# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for\n# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block\n# our synchronous write(2) call.\n#\n# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option\n# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a\n# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.\n#\n# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is\n# the same as \"appendfsync none\". In practical terms, this means that it is\n# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the\n# default Linux settings).\n# \n# If you have latency problems turn this to \"yes\". Otherwise leave it as\n# \"no\" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.\nno-appendfsync-on-rewrite no\n\n# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.\n# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling\n# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.\n# \n# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the\n# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of\n# the AOF at startup is used).\n#\n# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is\n# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also\n# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this\n# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase\n# is reached but it is still pretty small.\n#\n# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF\n# rewrite feature.\n\nauto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100\nauto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb\n\n################################ LUA SCRIPTING  ###############################\n\n# Max execution time of a Lua script in milliseconds.\n#\n# If the maximum execution time is reached Redis will log that a script is\n# still in execution after the maximum allowed time and will start to\n# reply to queries with an error.\n#\n# When a long running script exceed the maximum execution time only the\n# SCRIPT KILL and SHUTDOWN NOSAVE commands are available. The first can be\n# used to stop a script that did not yet called write commands. The second\n# is the only way to shut down the server in the case a write commands was\n# already issue by the script but the user don't want to wait for the natural\n# termination of the script.\n#\n# Set it to 0 or a negative value for unlimited execution without warnings.\nlua-time-limit 5000\n\n################################## SLOW LOG ###################################\n\n# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified\n# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations\n# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,\n# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only\n# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve\n# other requests in the meantime).\n# \n# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis\n# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the\n# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the\n# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the\n# queue of logged commands.\n\n# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent\n# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while\n# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.\nslowlog-log-slower-than 10000\n\n# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.\n# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.\nslowlog-max-len 128\n\n############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################\n\n# Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a\n# small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given\n# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.\nhash-max-ziplist-entries 512\nhash-max-ziplist-value 64\n\n# Similarly to hashes, small lists are also encoded in a special way in order\n# to save a lot of space. The special representation is only used when\n# you are under the following limits:\nlist-max-ziplist-entries 512\nlist-max-ziplist-value 64\n\n# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed\n# of just strings that happens to be integers in radix 10 in the range\n# of 64 bit signed integers.\n# The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the\n# set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.\nset-max-intset-entries 512\n\n# Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in\n# order to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and\n# elements of a sorted set are below the following limits:\nzset-max-ziplist-entries 128\nzset-max-ziplist-value 64\n\n# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in\n# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level\n# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)\n# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into an hash table\n# that is rehashing, the more rehashing \"steps\" are performed, so if the\n# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used\n# by the hash table.\n# \n# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to\n# active rehashing the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.\n#\n# If unsure:\n# use \"activerehashing no\" if you have hard latency requirements and it is\n# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply form time to time\n# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.\n#\n# use \"activerehashing yes\" if you don't have such hard requirements but\n# want to free memory asap when possible.\nactiverehashing yes\n\n# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients\n# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a\n# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the\n# publisher can produce them).\n#\n# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:\n#\n# normal -> normal clients\n# slave  -> slave clients and MONITOR clients\n# pubsub -> clients subcribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern\n#\n# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:\n#\n# client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>\n#\n# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if\n# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of\n# seconds (continuously).\n# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is\n# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately\n# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get\n# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes\n# the limit for 10 seconds.\n#\n# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data\n# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only\n# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster\n# than it can read.\n#\n# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and slave clients, since\n# subscribers and slaves receive data in a push fashion.\n#\n# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.\nclient-output-buffer-limit normal 0 0 0\nclient-output-buffer-limit slave 256mb 64mb 60\nclient-output-buffer-limit pubsub 32mb 8mb 60\n\n# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like\n# closing connections of clients in timeot, purging expired keys that are\n# never requested, and so forth.\n#\n# Not all tasks are perforemd with the same frequency, but Redis checks for\n# tasks to perform accordingly to the specified \"hz\" value.\n#\n# By default \"hz\" is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when\n# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when\n# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be\n# handled with more precision.\n#\n# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not\n# a good idea. Most users should use the default of 10 and raise this up to\n# 100 only in environments where very low latency is required.\nhz 10\n\n# When a child rewrites the AOF file, if the following option is enabled\n# the file will be fsync-ed every 32 MB of data generated.

The Zope configuration file\n# shows what the default configuration directives are, and show\n# examples for each directive.  To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <environment>\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    </environment>\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\ndebug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.  This file is used by zopectl.py to determine if Zope is\n#     currently running.  This defaults to CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    lock-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.lock\n\n\n# Directive: mime-types\n#\n# Description:\n#     Tells Zope about additional mime.types files that should be\n#     loaded.  The files have the same format as the mime.types file\n#     distributed with Apache.  The \"mime-types\" setting may be given\n#     more than once in the configuration file.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     mime-types  $INSTANCE/etc/mime.types\n\n\n# Directive: structured-text-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for structured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    structured-text-header-level 1\n\n# Directive: rest-input-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the input encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-input-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-output-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the output encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-output-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for restructured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-header-level 2\n\n# Directive: rest-language-code\n#\n# Description:\n#    Language code used for some internal translations inside of the docutils\n#    package and for DTD bibliographic elements mapping. See\n#    lib/python/docutils/languages/ for a list of supported language codes.\n#\n# Default: en\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-language-code de\n\n# Directive: cgi-environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which allows a user to define arbitrary key-value pairs for\n#     use as the initial CGI environment variables. This is useful\n#     when you want to proxy requests from another web server to Zserver,\n#     and would like Zserver's CGI environment to reflect the CGI\n#     environment of the other web server.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# <cgi-environment>\n#   HTTPS_SERVER Foobar Server 1.0\n#   HTTPS_PORT 443\n# </cgi-environment>\n\n<cgi-environment>\n  HTTPS ON\n</cgi-environment>\n\n\n# Directive: dns-server\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the IP address of your DNS server in order to cause resolved\n#     hostnames to be written to Zope's access log. By default, Zope will\n#     not resolve hostnames unless this is set.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    dns-server 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: ip-address\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol\n#     implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope\n#     will listen on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This\n#     directive can be overridden on a per-server basis in the servers\n#     section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    ip-address 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: http-realm\n#\n# Description:\n#     The HTTP \"Realm\" header value sent by this Zope instance. This value\n#     often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.\n#\n# Default: Zope\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    http-realm Slipknot\n\n\n# Directive: cgi-maxlen\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this value to limit the amount of form data being processed\n#     by Zope to prevent DoS attacks.\n#\n# Default: 0 (= no restrictions)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    cgi-maxlen 10000\n\n\n# Directive: http-header-max-length\n#\n# Description:\n#     Maximum number of bytes allowed within a HTTP request header. The request\n#     is discarded and considered as a DoS attack if the header size exceeds\n#     this limit.\n#\n# Default: 8192\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     http-header-max-length 16384\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-author-via\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the \"MS-Author-Via\" header\n#     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '<'\n#     when used in <dtml-var> construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '<' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a <dtml-var> or &dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - > Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.

Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file <instancehome>/log/Z2-zendebug.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     <instancehome>/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n<eventlog>\n  level info\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event-zendebug.log\n    level info\n  </logfile>\n</eventlog>\n\n<logger access>\n  level WARN\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2-zendebug.log\n    format %(message)s\n  </logfile>\n</logger>\n\n# <logger trace>\n#   level WARN\n#   <logfile>\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   </logfile>\n# </logger>\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user. You can specify 'notset' if you don't\n#     want them logged, or use any other logger level (see above).\n#\n# Default: info\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    conflict-error-log-level blather\nconflict-error-log-level debug\n\n\n# Directive: warnfilter\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section that allows you to define a warning filter.\n#     The following keys are valid within a warnfilter section:\n#\n#      action:  one of the following strings:\n#\n#           \"error\"   turn matching warnings into exceptions\n#           \"ignore\"  never print matching warnings\n#           \"always\"  always print matching warnings\n#           \"default\" print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each location where the warning is issued\n#           \"module\"  print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each module where the warning is issued\n#           \"once\"    print only the first occurrence of matching\n#                     warnings, regardless of location\n#\n#      message:  a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                warning message must match (the match is compiled to\n#                always be case-insensitive)\n#\n#      category: a Python dotted-path classname (must be a subclass of\n#                Warning) of which the warning category must be a subclass in\n#                order to match\n#\n#      module:   a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                module name must match (the match is compiled to be\n#                case-sensitive)\n#\n#      lineno:   an integer that the line number where the warning\n#                occurred must match, or 0 to match all line numbers\n#\n#     All keys within a warnfilter section are optional.  More than\n#     one warnfilter section may be specified.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <warnfilter>\n#       action ignore\n#       category exceptions.DeprecationWarning\n#    </warnfilter>\n\n\n# Directive: max-listen-sockets\n#\n# Description:\n#     The maximum number of sockets that ZServer will attempt to open\n#     in order to service incoming connections.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    max-listen-sockets 500\n\n\n# Directives: port-base\n#\n# Description:\n#     Offset applied to the port numbers used for ZServer\n#     configurations.  For example, if the http-server port is 8080 and\n#     the port-base is 1000, the HTTP server will listen on port 9310.\n#     This makes it easy to change the complete set of ports used by a\n#     Zope server process\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     0\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     port-base 1000\n\n\n# Directive: large-file-threshold\n#\n# Description:\n#     Requests bigger than this size get saved into a temporary file\n#     instead of being read completely into memory.\n#\n# Default: 512K\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    large-file-threshold 1Mb\n\n# Directive: default-zpublisher-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#     This controls what character set is used to encode unicode\n#     data that reaches ZPublisher without any other specified encoding.\n#\n# Default: iso-8859-15\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    default-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directives: servers\n#\n# Description:\n#     A set of sections which allow the specification of Zope's various\n#     ZServer servers.  8 different server types may be defined:\n#     http-server, ftp-server, webdav-source-server, persistent-cgi,\n#     fast-cgi, monitor-server, icp-server, and clock-server.  If no servers\n#     are defined, the default servers are used.\n#\n#     Ports may be specified using the 'address' directive either in simple\n#     form (80) or in complex form including hostname 127.0.0.1:80.  If the\n#     hostname is \"left off\", the default-ip-address is used as the hostname.\n#\n#     Port numbers are offset by the setting of port-base.\n#\n#     To run the monitor-server an emergency user must be defined\n#     (through an 'access' file).\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     An HTTP server starts on port 8080.\n\n<http-server>\n  # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n  address 9310\n\n  # force-connection-close on\n  #\n  # You can also use the WSGI interface between ZServer and ZPublisher:\n  # use-wsgi on\n  #\n  # To defer the opening of the HTTP socket until the end of the\n  # startup phase:\n  # fast-listen off\n</http-server>\n\n# Examples:\n#\n#  <ftp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 8021\n#  </ftp-server>\n#\n#  <webdav-source-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n#    address 1980\n#    force-connection-close off\n#  </webdav-source-server>\n#\n#  <persistent-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"path\"\n#    path somefile\n#  </persistent-cgi>\n#\n#  <fast-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"; the address may be hostname:port, port,\n#    # or a path for a Unix-domain socket\n#    address somefile\n#  </fast-cgi>\n#\n#  <monitor-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\"\n#    address 8099\n#  </monitor-server>\n#\n#  <icp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 888\n#  </icp-server>\n#\n#  <clock-server>\n#    # starts a clock which calls /foo/bar every 30 seconds\n#    method /foo/bar\n#    period 30\n#    user admin\n#    password 123\n#  </clock-server>\n\n# Database (zodb_db) section\n#\n# Description:\n#     A database section allows the definition of custom database and\n#     storage types.

The Zope configuration file\n# shows what the default configuration directives are, and show\n# examples for each directive.  To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <environment>\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    </environment>\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\ndebug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.  This file is used by zopectl.py to determine if Zope is\n#     currently running.  This defaults to CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    lock-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.lock\n\n\n# Directive: mime-types\n#\n# Description:\n#     Tells Zope about additional mime.types files that should be\n#     loaded.  The files have the same format as the mime.types file\n#     distributed with Apache.  The \"mime-types\" setting may be given\n#     more than once in the configuration file.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     mime-types  $INSTANCE/etc/mime.types\n\n\n# Directive: structured-text-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for structured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    structured-text-header-level 1\n\n# Directive: rest-input-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the input encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-input-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-output-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the output encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-output-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for restructured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-header-level 2\n\n# Directive: rest-language-code\n#\n# Description:\n#    Language code used for some internal translations inside of the docutils\n#    package and for DTD bibliographic elements mapping. See\n#    lib/python/docutils/languages/ for a list of supported language codes.\n#\n# Default: en\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-language-code de\n\n# Directive: cgi-environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which allows a user to define arbitrary key-value pairs for\n#     use as the initial CGI environment variables. This is useful\n#     when you want to proxy requests from another web server to Zserver,\n#     and would like Zserver's CGI environment to reflect the CGI\n#     environment of the other web server.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# <cgi-environment>\n#   HTTPS_SERVER Foobar Server 1.0\n#   HTTPS_PORT 443\n# </cgi-environment>\n\n<cgi-environment>\n  HTTPS ON\n</cgi-environment>\n\n\n# Directive: dns-server\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the IP address of your DNS server in order to cause resolved\n#     hostnames to be written to Zope's access log. By default, Zope will\n#     not resolve hostnames unless this is set.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    dns-server 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: ip-address\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol\n#     implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope\n#     will listen on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This\n#     directive can be overridden on a per-server basis in the servers\n#     section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    ip-address 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: http-realm\n#\n# Description:\n#     The HTTP \"Realm\" header value sent by this Zope instance. This value\n#     often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.\n#\n# Default: Zope\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    http-realm Slipknot\n\n\n# Directive: cgi-maxlen\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this value to limit the amount of form data being processed\n#     by Zope to prevent DoS attacks.\n#\n# Default: 0 (= no restrictions)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    cgi-maxlen 10000\n\n\n# Directive: http-header-max-length\n#\n# Description:\n#     Maximum number of bytes allowed within a HTTP request header. The request\n#     is discarded and considered as a DoS attack if the header size exceeds\n#     this limit.\n#\n# Default: 8192\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     http-header-max-length 16384\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-author-via\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the \"MS-Author-Via\" header\n#     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '<'\n#     when used in <dtml-var> construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '<' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a <dtml-var> or &dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - > Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\nsession-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper access rule.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-access-rules on\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-site-roots\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no site roots in your Zope site will\n#     be effective. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper site root.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-site-roots on\n\n\n# Directive: database-quota-size\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to an integer in bytes in order to place a hard\n#     limit on the size which the default FileStorage-backed Zope database\n#     can grow. Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file <instancehome>/log/Z2-zendebug.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     <instancehome>/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n<eventlog>\n  level info\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event-zendebug.log\n    level info\n  </logfile>\n</eventlog>\n\n<logger access>\n  level WARN\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2-zendebug.log\n    format %(message)s\n  </logfile>\n</logger>\n\n# <logger trace>\n#   level WARN\n#   <logfile>\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   </logfile>\n# </logger>\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user. You can specify 'notset' if you don't\n#     want them logged, or use any other logger level (see above).\n#\n# Default: info\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    conflict-error-log-level blather\nconflict-error-log-level debug\n\n\n# Directive: warnfilter\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section that allows you to define a warning filter.\n#     The following keys are valid within a warnfilter section:\n#\n#      action:  one of the following strings:\n#\n#           \"error\"   turn matching warnings into exceptions\n#           \"ignore\"  never print matching warnings\n#           \"always\"  always print matching warnings\n#           \"default\" print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each location where the warning is issued\n#           \"module\"  print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each module where the warning is issued\n#           \"once\"    print only the first occurrence of matching\n#                     warnings, regardless of location\n#\n#      message:  a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                warning message must match (the match is compiled to\n#                always be case-insensitive)\n#\n#      category: a Python dotted-path classname (must be a subclass of\n#                Warning) of which the warning category must be a subclass in\n#                order to match\n#\n#      module:   a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                module name must match (the match is compiled to be\n#                case-sensitive)\n#\n#      lineno:   an integer that the line number where the warning\n#                occurred must match, or 0 to match all line numbers\n#\n#     All keys within a warnfilter section are optional.  More than\n#     one warnfilter section may be specified.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <warnfilter>\n#       action ignore\n#       category exceptions.DeprecationWarning\n#    </warnfilter>\n\n\n# Directive: max-listen-sockets\n#\n# Description:\n#     The maximum number of sockets that ZServer will attempt to open\n#     in order to service incoming connections.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    max-listen-sockets 500\n\n\n# Directives: port-base\n#\n# Description:\n#     Offset applied to the port numbers used for ZServer\n#     configurations.  For example, if the http-server port is 8080 and\n#     the port-base is 1000, the HTTP server will listen on port 9310.\n#     This makes it easy to change the complete set of ports used by a\n#     Zope server process\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     0\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     port-base 1000\n\n\n# Directive: large-file-threshold\n#\n# Description:\n#     Requests bigger than this size get saved into a temporary file\n#     instead of being read completely into memory.\n#\n# Default: 512K\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    large-file-threshold 1Mb\n\n# Directive: default-zpublisher-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#     This controls what character set is used to encode unicode\n#     data that reaches ZPublisher without any other specified encoding.\n#\n# Default: iso-8859-15\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    default-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directives: servers\n#\n# Description:\n#     A set of sections which allow the specification of Zope's various\n#     ZServer servers.  8 different server types may be defined:\n#     http-server, ftp-server, webdav-source-server, persistent-cgi,\n#     fast-cgi, monitor-server, icp-server, and clock-server.  If no servers\n#     are defined, the default servers are used.\n#\n#     Ports may be specified using the 'address' directive either in simple\n#     form (80) or in complex form including hostname 127.0.0.1:80.  If the\n#     hostname is \"left off\", the default-ip-address is used as the hostname.\n#\n#     Port numbers are offset by the setting of port-base.\n#\n#     To run the monitor-server an emergency user must be defined\n#     (through an 'access' file).\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     An HTTP server starts on port 8080.\n\n<http-server>\n  # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n  address 9310\n\n  # force-connection-close on\n  #\n  # You can also use the WSGI interface between ZServer and ZPublisher:\n  # use-wsgi on\n  #\n  # To defer the opening of the HTTP socket until the end of the\n  # startup phase:\n  # fast-listen off\n</http-server>\n\n# Examples:\n#\n#  <ftp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 8021\n#  </ftp-server>\n#\n#  <webdav-source-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n#    address 1980\n#    force-connection-close off\n#  </webdav-source-server>\n#\n#  <persistent-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"path\"\n#    path somefile\n#  </persistent-cgi>\n#\n#  <fast-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"; the address may be hostname:port, port,\n#    # or a path for a Unix-domain socket\n#    address somefile\n#  </fast-cgi>\n#\n#  <monitor-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\"\n#    address 8099\n#  </monitor-server>\n#\n#  <icp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 888\n#  </icp-server>\n#\n#  <clock-server>\n#    # starts a clock which calls /foo/bar every 30 seconds\n#    method /foo/bar\n#    period 30\n#    user admin\n#    password 123\n#  </clock-server>\n\n# Database (zodb_db) section\n#\n# Description:\n#     A database section allows the definition of custom database and\n#     storage types.

The Zope configuration file\n# shows what the default configuration directives are, and show\n# examples for each directive.  To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <environment>\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    </environment>\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    debug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.  This file is used by zopectl.py to determine if Zope is\n#     currently running.  This defaults to CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    lock-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.lock\n\n\n# Directive: mime-types\n#\n# Description:\n#     Tells Zope about additional mime.types files that should be\n#     loaded.  The files have the same format as the mime.types file\n#     distributed with Apache.  The \"mime-types\" setting may be given\n#     more than once in the configuration file.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     mime-types  $INSTANCE/etc/mime.types\n\n\n# Directive: structured-text-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for structured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    structured-text-header-level 1\n\n# Directive: rest-input-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the input encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-input-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-output-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the output encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-output-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for restructured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-header-level 2\n\n# Directive: rest-language-code\n#\n# Description:\n#    Language code used for some internal translations inside of the docutils\n#    package and for DTD bibliographic elements mapping. See\n#    lib/python/docutils/languages/ for a list of supported language codes.\n#\n# Default: en\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-language-code de\n\n# Directive: cgi-environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which allows a user to define arbitrary key-value pairs for\n#     use as the initial CGI environment variables. This is useful\n#     when you want to proxy requests from another web server to Zserver,\n#     and would like Zserver's CGI environment to reflect the CGI\n#     environment of the other web server.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# <cgi-environment>\n#   HTTPS_SERVER Foobar Server 1.0\n#   HTTPS_PORT 443\n# </cgi-environment>\n\n<cgi-environment>\n  HTTPS ON\n</cgi-environment>\n\n\n# Directive: dns-server\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the IP address of your DNS server in order to cause resolved\n#     hostnames to be written to Zope's access log. By default, Zope will\n#     not resolve hostnames unless this is set.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    dns-server 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: ip-address\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol\n#     implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope\n#     will listen on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This\n#     directive can be overridden on a per-server basis in the servers\n#     section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    ip-address 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: http-realm\n#\n# Description:\n#     The HTTP \"Realm\" header value sent by this Zope instance. This value\n#     often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.\n#\n# Default: Zope\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    http-realm Slipknot\n\n\n# Directive: cgi-maxlen\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this value to limit the amount of form data being processed\n#     by Zope to prevent DoS attacks.\n#\n# Default: 0 (= no restrictions)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    cgi-maxlen 10000\n\n\n# Directive: http-header-max-length\n#\n# Description:\n#     Maximum number of bytes allowed within a HTTP request header. The request\n#     is discarded and considered as a DoS attack if the header size exceeds\n#     this limit.\n#\n# Default: 8192\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     http-header-max-length 16384\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-author-via\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the \"MS-Author-Via\" header\n#     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '<'\n#     when used in <dtml-var> construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '<' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a <dtml-var> or &dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - > Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\nsession-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper access rule.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-access-rules on\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-site-roots\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no site roots in your Zope site will\n#     be effective. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper site root.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-site-roots on\n\n\n# Directive: database-quota-size\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to an integer in bytes in order to place a hard\n#     limit on the size which the default FileStorage-backed Zope database\n#     can grow. Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file <instancehome>/log/Z2.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     <instancehome>/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n<eventlog>\n  level info\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event.log\n    level info\n  </logfile>\n</eventlog>\n\n<logger access>\n  level WARN\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2.log\n    format %(message)s\n  </logfile>\n</logger>\n\n# <logger trace>\n#   level WARN\n#   <logfile>\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   </logfile>\n# </logger>\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user. You can specify 'notset' if you don't\n#     want them logged, or use any other logger level (see above).\n#\n# Default: info\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    conflict-error-log-level blather\nconflict-error-log-level debug\n\n\n# Directive: warnfilter\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section that allows you to define a warning filter.\n#     The following keys are valid within a warnfilter section:\n#\n#      action:  one of the following strings:\n#\n#           \"error\"   turn matching warnings into exceptions\n#           \"ignore\"  never print matching warnings\n#           \"always\"  always print matching warnings\n#           \"default\" print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each location where the warning is issued\n#           \"module\"  print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each module where the warning is issued\n#           \"once\"    print only the first occurrence of matching\n#                     warnings, regardless of location\n#\n#      message:  a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                warning message must match (the match is compiled to\n#                always be case-insensitive)\n#\n#      category: a Python dotted-path classname (must be a subclass of\n#                Warning) of which the warning category must be a subclass in\n#                order to match\n#\n#      module:   a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                module name must match (the match is compiled to be\n#                case-sensitive)\n#\n#      lineno:   an integer that the line number where the warning\n#                occurred must match, or 0 to match all line numbers\n#\n#     All keys within a warnfilter section are optional.  More than\n#     one warnfilter section may be specified.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <warnfilter>\n#       action ignore\n#       category exceptions.DeprecationWarning\n#    </warnfilter>\n\n\n# Directive: max-listen-sockets\n#\n# Description:\n#     The maximum number of sockets that ZServer will attempt to open\n#     in order to service incoming connections.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    max-listen-sockets 500\n\n\n# Directives: port-base\n#\n# Description:\n#     Offset applied to the port numbers used for ZServer\n#     configurations.  For example, if the http-server port is 8080 and\n#     the port-base is 1000, the HTTP server will listen on port 9290.\n#     This makes it easy to change the complete set of ports used by a\n#     Zope server process\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     0\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     port-base 1000\n\n\n# Directive: large-file-threshold\n#\n# Description:\n#     Requests bigger than this size get saved into a temporary file\n#     instead of being read completely into memory.\n#\n# Default: 512K\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    large-file-threshold 1Mb\n\n# Directive: default-zpublisher-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#     This controls what character set is used to encode unicode\n#     data that reaches ZPublisher without any other specified encoding.\n#\n# Default: iso-8859-15\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    default-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directives: servers\n#\n# Description:\n#     A set of sections which allow the specification of Zope's various\n#     ZServer servers.  8 different server types may be defined:\n#     http-server, ftp-server, webdav-source-server, persistent-cgi,\n#     fast-cgi, monitor-server, icp-server, and clock-server.  If no servers\n#     are defined, the default servers are used.\n#\n#     Ports may be specified using the 'address' directive either in simple\n#     form (80) or in complex form including hostname 127.0.0.1:80.  If the\n#     hostname is \"left off\", the default-ip-address is used as the hostname.\n#\n#     Port numbers are offset by the setting of port-base.\n#\n#     To run the monitor-server an emergency user must be defined\n#     (through an 'access' file).\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     An HTTP server starts on port 8080.\n\n<http-server>\n  # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n  address 9290\n\n  # force-connection-close on\n  #\n  # You can also use the WSGI interface between ZServer and ZPublisher:\n  # use-wsgi on\n  #\n  # To defer the opening of the HTTP socket until the end of the\n  # startup phase:\n  # fast-listen off\n</http-server>\n\n# Examples:\n#\n#  <ftp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 8021\n#  </ftp-server>\n#\n#  <webdav-source-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n#    address 1980\n#    force-connection-close off\n#  </webdav-source-server>\n#\n#  <persistent-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"path\"\n#    path somefile\n#  </persistent-cgi>\n#\n#  <fast-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"; the address may be hostname:port, port,\n#    # or a path for a Unix-domain socket\n#    address somefile\n#  </fast-cgi>\n#\n#  <monitor-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\"\n#    address 8099\n#  </monitor-server>\n#\n#  <icp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 888\n#  </icp-server>\n#\n#  <clock-server>\n#    # starts a clock which calls /foo/bar every 30 seconds\n#    method /foo/bar\n#    period 30\n#    user admin\n#    password 123\n#  </clock-server>\n\n# Database (zodb_db) section\n#\n# Description:\n#     A database section allows the definition of custom database and\n#     storage types.

The Zope configuration file\n# shows what the default configuration directives are, and show\n# examples for each directive.  To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <environment>\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    </environment>\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    debug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.  This file is used by zopectl.py to determine if Zope is\n#     currently running.  This defaults to CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    lock-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.lock\n\n\n# Directive: mime-types\n#\n# Description:\n#     Tells Zope about additional mime.types files that should be\n#     loaded.  The files have the same format as the mime.types file\n#     distributed with Apache.  The \"mime-types\" setting may be given\n#     more than once in the configuration file.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     mime-types  $INSTANCE/etc/mime.types\n\n\n# Directive: structured-text-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for structured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    structured-text-header-level 1\n\n# Directive: rest-input-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the input encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-input-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-output-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the output encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-output-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for restructured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-header-level 2\n\n# Directive: rest-language-code\n#\n# Description:\n#    Language code used for some internal translations inside of the docutils\n#    package and for DTD bibliographic elements mapping. See\n#    lib/python/docutils/languages/ for a list of supported language codes.\n#\n# Default: en\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-language-code de\n\n# Directive: cgi-environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which allows a user to define arbitrary key-value pairs for\n#     use as the initial CGI environment variables. This is useful\n#     when you want to proxy requests from another web server to Zserver,\n#     and would like Zserver's CGI environment to reflect the CGI\n#     environment of the other web server.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# <cgi-environment>\n#   HTTPS_SERVER Foobar Server 1.0\n#   HTTPS_PORT 443\n# </cgi-environment>\n\n<cgi-environment>\n  HTTPS ON\n</cgi-environment>\n\n\n# Directive: dns-server\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the IP address of your DNS server in order to cause resolved\n#     hostnames to be written to Zope's access log. By default, Zope will\n#     not resolve hostnames unless this is set.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    dns-server 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: ip-address\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol\n#     implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope\n#     will listen on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This\n#     directive can be overridden on a per-server basis in the servers\n#     section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    ip-address 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: http-realm\n#\n# Description:\n#     The HTTP \"Realm\" header value sent by this Zope instance. This value\n#     often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.\n#\n# Default: Zope\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    http-realm Slipknot\n\n\n# Directive: cgi-maxlen\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this value to limit the amount of form data being processed\n#     by Zope to prevent DoS attacks.\n#\n# Default: 0 (= no restrictions)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    cgi-maxlen 10000\n\n\n# Directive: http-header-max-length\n#\n# Description:\n#     Maximum number of bytes allowed within a HTTP request header. The request\n#     is discarded and considered as a DoS attack if the header size exceeds\n#     this limit.\n#\n# Default: 8192\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     http-header-max-length 16384\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-author-via\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the \"MS-Author-Via\" header\n#     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '<'\n#     when used in <dtml-var> construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '<' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a <dtml-var> or &dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - > Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\nsession-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper access rule.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-access-rules on\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-site-roots\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no site roots in your Zope site will\n#     be effective.

Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file <instancehome>/log/Z2.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     <instancehome>/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n<eventlog>\n  level info\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event.log\n    level info\n  </logfile>\n</eventlog>\n\n<logger access>\n  level WARN\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2.log\n    format %(message)s\n  </logfile>\n</logger>\n\n# <logger trace>\n#   level WARN\n#   <logfile>\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   </logfile>\n# </logger>\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user.

The Zope configuration file\n# shows what the default configuration directives are, and show\n# examples for each directive.  To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <environment>\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    </environment>\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    debug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.  This file is used by zopectl.py to determine if Zope is\n#     currently running.  This defaults to CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    lock-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.lock\n\n\n# Directive: mime-types\n#\n# Description:\n#     Tells Zope about additional mime.types files that should be\n#     loaded.  The files have the same format as the mime.types file\n#     distributed with Apache.  The \"mime-types\" setting may be given\n#     more than once in the configuration file.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     mime-types  $INSTANCE/etc/mime.types\n\n\n# Directive: structured-text-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for structured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    structured-text-header-level 1\n\n# Directive: rest-input-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the input encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-input-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-output-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the output encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-output-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for restructured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-header-level 2\n\n# Directive: rest-language-code\n#\n# Description:\n#    Language code used for some internal translations inside of the docutils\n#    package and for DTD bibliographic elements mapping. See\n#    lib/python/docutils/languages/ for a list of supported language codes.\n#\n# Default: en\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-language-code de\n\n# Directive: cgi-environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which allows a user to define arbitrary key-value pairs for\n#     use as the initial CGI environment variables. This is useful\n#     when you want to proxy requests from another web server to Zserver,\n#     and would like Zserver's CGI environment to reflect the CGI\n#     environment of the other web server.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# <cgi-environment>\n#   HTTPS_SERVER Foobar Server 1.0\n#   HTTPS_PORT 443\n# </cgi-environment>\n\n\n\n# Directive: dns-server\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the IP address of your DNS server in order to cause resolved\n#     hostnames to be written to Zope's access log. By default, Zope will\n#     not resolve hostnames unless this is set.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    dns-server 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: ip-address\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol\n#     implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope\n#     will listen on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This\n#     directive can be overridden on a per-server basis in the servers\n#     section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    ip-address 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: http-realm\n#\n# Description:\n#     The HTTP \"Realm\" header value sent by this Zope instance. This value\n#     often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.\n#\n# Default: Zope\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    http-realm Slipknot\n\n\n# Directive: cgi-maxlen\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this value to limit the amount of form data being processed\n#     by Zope to prevent DoS attacks.\n#\n# Default: 0 (= no restrictions)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    cgi-maxlen 10000\n\n\n# Directive: http-header-max-length\n#\n# Description:\n#     Maximum number of bytes allowed within a HTTP request header. The request\n#     is discarded and considered as a DoS attack if the header size exceeds\n#     this limit.\n#\n# Default: 8192\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     http-header-max-length 16384\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-author-via\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the \"MS-Author-Via\" header\n#     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '<'\n#     when used in <dtml-var> construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '<' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a <dtml-var> or &dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - > Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper access rule.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-access-rules on\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-site-roots\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no site roots in your Zope site will\n#     be effective. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper site root.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-site-roots on\n\n\n# Directive: database-quota-size\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to an integer in bytes in order to place a hard\n#     limit on the size which the default FileStorage-backed Zope database\n#     can grow. Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file <instancehome>/log/Z2.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     <instancehome>/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n<eventlog>\n  level info\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event.log\n    level info\n  </logfile>\n</eventlog>\n\n<logger access>\n  level WARN\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2.log\n    format %(message)s\n  </logfile>\n</logger>\n\n# <logger trace>\n#   level WARN\n#   <logfile>\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   </logfile>\n# </logger>\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user. You can specify 'notset' if you don't\n#     want them logged, or use any other logger level (see above).\n#\n# Default: info\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    conflict-error-log-level blather\n\n\n# Directive: warnfilter\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section that allows you to define a warning filter.\n#     The following keys are valid within a warnfilter section:\n#\n#      action:  one of the following strings:\n#\n#           \"error\"   turn matching warnings into exceptions\n#           \"ignore\"  never print matching warnings\n#           \"always\"  always print matching warnings\n#           \"default\" print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each location where the warning is issued\n#           \"module\"  print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each module where the warning is issued\n#           \"once\"    print only the first occurrence of matching\n#                     warnings, regardless of location\n#\n#      message:  a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                warning message must match (the match is compiled to\n#                always be case-insensitive)\n#\n#      category: a Python dotted-path classname (must be a subclass of\n#                Warning) of which the warning category must be a subclass in\n#                order to match\n#\n#      module:   a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                module name must match (the match is compiled to be\n#                case-sensitive)\n#\n#      lineno:   an integer that the line number where the warning\n#                occurred must match, or 0 to match all line numbers\n#\n#     All keys within a warnfilter section are optional.  More than\n#     one warnfilter section may be specified.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <warnfilter>\n#       action ignore\n#       category exceptions.DeprecationWarning\n#    </warnfilter>\n\n\n# Directive: max-listen-sockets\n#\n# Description:\n#     The maximum number of sockets that ZServer will attempt to open\n#     in order to service incoming connections.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    max-listen-sockets 500\n\n\n# Directives: port-base\n#\n# Description:\n#     Offset applied to the port numbers used for ZServer\n#     configurations.  For example, if the http-server port is 8080 and\n#     the port-base is 1000, the HTTP server will listen on port 9080.\n#     This makes it easy to change the complete set of ports used by a\n#     Zope server process\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     0\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     port-base 1000\n\n\n# Directive: large-file-threshold\n#\n# Description:\n#     Requests bigger than this size get saved into a temporary file\n#     instead of being read completely into memory.\n#\n# Default: 512K\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    large-file-threshold 1Mb\n\n# Directive: default-zpublisher-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#     This controls what character set is used to encode unicode\n#     data that reaches ZPublisher without any other specified encoding.\n#\n# Default: iso-8859-15\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    default-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\nconflict-error-log-level debug\n\n# Directives: servers\n#\n# Description:\n#     A set of sections which allow the specification of Zope's various\n#     ZServer servers.  8 different server types may be defined:\n#     http-server, ftp-server, webdav-source-server, persistent-cgi,\n#     fast-cgi, monitor-server, icp-server, and clock-server.  If no servers\n#     are defined, the default servers are used.\n#\n#     Ports may be specified using the 'address' directive either in simple\n#     form (80) or in complex form including hostname 127.0.0.1:80.

The Zope configuration file\n# shows what the default configuration directives are, and show\n# examples for each directive.  To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <environment>\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    </environment>\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    debug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.

This defaults to CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    lock-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.lock\n\n\n# Directive: mime-types\n#\n# Description:\n#     Tells Zope about additional mime.types files that should be\n#     loaded.  The files have the same format as the mime.types file\n#     distributed with Apache.  The \"mime-types\" setting may be given\n#     more than once in the configuration file.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     mime-types  $INSTANCE/etc/mime.types\n\n\n# Directive: structured-text-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for structured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    structured-text-header-level 1\n\n# Directive: rest-input-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the input encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-input-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-output-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the output encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).

This is useful\n#     when you want to proxy requests from another web server to Zserver,\n#     and would like Zserver's CGI environment to reflect the CGI\n#     environment of the other web server.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# <cgi-environment>\n#   HTTPS_SERVER Foobar Server 1.0\n#   HTTPS_PORT 443\n# </cgi-environment>\n\n\n\n# Directive: dns-server\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the IP address of your DNS server in order to cause resolved\n#     hostnames to be written to Zope's access log. By default, Zope will\n#     not resolve hostnames unless this is set.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    dns-server 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: ip-address\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol\n#     implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope\n#     will listen on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This\n#     directive can be overridden on a per-server basis in the servers\n#     section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    ip-address 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: http-realm\n#\n# Description:\n#     The HTTP \"Realm\" header value sent by this Zope instance.

The request\n#     is discarded and considered as a DoS attack if the header size exceeds\n#     this limit.\n#\n# Default: 8192\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     http-header-max-length 16384\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-author-via\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the \"MS-Author-Via\" header\n#     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '<'\n#     when used in <dtml-var> construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '<' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a <dtml-var> or &dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - > Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper access rule.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-access-rules on\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-site-roots\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no site roots in your Zope site will\n#     be effective. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper site root.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-site-roots on\n\n\n# Directive: database-quota-size\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to an integer in bytes in order to place a hard\n#     limit on the size which the default FileStorage-backed Zope database\n#     can grow. Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file <instancehome>/log/Z2.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     <instancehome>/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n<eventlog>\n  level info\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event.log\n    level info\n  </logfile>\n</eventlog>\n\n<logger access>\n  level WARN\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2.log\n    format %(message)s\n  </logfile>\n</logger>\n\n# <logger trace>\n#   level WARN\n#   <logfile>\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   </logfile>\n# </logger>\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user. You can specify 'notset' if you don't\n#     want them logged, or use any other logger level (see above).\n#\n# Default: info\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    conflict-error-log-level blather\n\n\n# Directive: warnfilter\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section that allows you to define a warning filter.\n#     The following keys are valid within a warnfilter section:\n#\n#      action:  one of the following strings:\n#\n#           \"error\"   turn matching warnings into exceptions\n#           \"ignore\"  never print matching warnings\n#           \"always\"  always print matching warnings\n#           \"default\" print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each location where the warning is issued\n#           \"module\"  print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each module where the warning is issued\n#           \"once\"    print only the first occurrence of matching\n#                     warnings, regardless of location\n#\n#      message:  a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                warning message must match (the match is compiled to\n#                always be case-insensitive)\n#\n#      category: a Python dotted-path classname (must be a subclass of\n#                Warning) of which the warning category must be a subclass in\n#                order to match\n#\n#      module:   a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                module name must match (the match is compiled to be\n#                case-sensitive)\n#\n#      lineno:   an integer that the line number where the warning\n#                occurred must match, or 0 to match all line numbers\n#\n#     All keys within a warnfilter section are optional.

If the\n#     hostname is \"left off\", the default-ip-address is used as the hostname.\n#\n#     Port numbers are offset by the setting of port-base.\n#\n#     To run the monitor-server an emergency user must be defined\n#     (through an 'access' file).\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     An HTTP server starts on port 8080.\n\n<http-server>\n  # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n  address 9080\n\n  # force-connection-close on\n  #\n  # You can also use the WSGI interface between ZServer and ZPublisher:\n  # use-wsgi on\n  #\n  # To defer the opening of the HTTP socket until the end of the\n  # startup phase:\n  # fast-listen off\n</http-server>\n\n# Examples:\n#\n#  <ftp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 8021\n#  </ftp-server>\n#\n#  <webdav-source-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n#    address 1980\n#    force-connection-close off\n#  </webdav-source-server>\n#\n#  <persistent-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"path\"\n#    path somefile\n#  </persistent-cgi>\n#\n#  <fast-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"; the address may be hostname:port, port,\n#    # or a path for a Unix-domain socket\n#    address somefile\n#  </fast-cgi>\n#\n#  <monitor-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\"\n#    address 8099\n#  </monitor-server>\n#\n#  <icp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 888\n#  </icp-server>\n#\n#  <clock-server>\n#    # starts a clock which calls /foo/bar every 30 seconds\n#    method /foo/bar\n#    period 30\n#    user admin\n#    password 123\n#  </clock-server>\n\n# Database (zodb_db) section\n#\n# Description:\n#     A database section allows the definition of custom database and\n#     storage types.

The Zope configuration file\n# shows what the default configuration directives are, and show\n# examples for each directive.  To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <environment>\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    </environment>\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    debug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers.

Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '<'\n#     when used in <dtml-var> construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '<' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a <dtml-var> or &dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - > Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\nsession-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper access rule.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-access-rules on\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-site-roots\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no site roots in your Zope site will\n#     be effective. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper site root.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-site-roots on\n\n\n# Directive: database-quota-size\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to an integer in bytes in order to place a hard\n#     limit on the size which the default FileStorage-backed Zope database\n#     can grow. Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file <instancehome>/log/Z2.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     <instancehome>/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n<eventlog>\n  level info\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event.log\n    level info\n  </logfile>\n</eventlog>\n\n<logger access>\n  level WARN\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2.log\n    format %(message)s\n  </logfile>\n</logger>\n\n# <logger trace>\n#   level WARN\n#   <logfile>\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   </logfile>\n# </logger>\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user. You can specify 'notset' if you don't\n#     want them logged, or use any other logger level (see above).\n#\n# Default: info\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    conflict-error-log-level blather\nconflict-error-log-level debug\n\n\n# Directive: warnfilter\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section that allows you to define a warning filter.\n#     The following keys are valid within a warnfilter section:\n#\n#      action:  one of the following strings:\n#\n#           \"error\"   turn matching warnings into exceptions\n#           \"ignore\"  never print matching warnings\n#           \"always\"  always print matching warnings\n#           \"default\" print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each location where the warning is issued\n#           \"module\"  print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each module where the warning is issued\n#           \"once\"    print only the first occurrence of matching\n#                     warnings, regardless of location\n#\n#      message:  a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                warning message must match (the match is compiled to\n#                always be case-insensitive)\n#\n#      category: a Python dotted-path classname (must be a subclass of\n#                Warning) of which the warning category must be a subclass in\n#                order to match\n#\n#      module:   a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                module name must match (the match is compiled to be\n#                case-sensitive)\n#\n#      lineno:   an integer that the line number where the warning\n#                occurred must match, or 0 to match all line numbers\n#\n#     All keys within a warnfilter section are optional.

Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <environment>\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    </environment>\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    debug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.  This file is used by zopectl.py to determine if Zope is\n#     currently running.  This defaults to CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    lock-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.lock\n\n\n# Directive: mime-types\n#\n# Description:\n#     Tells Zope about additional mime.types files that should be\n#     loaded.  The files have the same format as the mime.types file\n#     distributed with Apache.  The \"mime-types\" setting may be given\n#     more than once in the configuration file.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     mime-types  $INSTANCE/etc/mime.types\n\n\n# Directive: structured-text-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for structured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    structured-text-header-level 1\n\n# Directive: rest-input-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the input encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-input-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-output-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the output encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-output-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for restructured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-header-level 2\n\n# Directive: rest-language-code\n#\n# Description:\n#    Language code used for some internal translations inside of the docutils\n#    package and for DTD bibliographic elements mapping. See\n#    lib/python/docutils/languages/ for a list of supported language codes.\n#\n# Default: en\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-language-code de\n\n# Directive: cgi-environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which allows a user to define arbitrary key-value pairs for\n#     use as the initial CGI environment variables. This is useful\n#     when you want to proxy requests from another web server to Zserver,\n#     and would like Zserver's CGI environment to reflect the CGI\n#     environment of the other web server.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# <cgi-environment>\n#   HTTPS_SERVER Foobar Server 1.0\n#   HTTPS_PORT 443\n# </cgi-environment>\n\n<cgi-environment>\n  HTTPS ON\n</cgi-environment>\n\n\n# Directive: dns-server\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the IP address of your DNS server in order to cause resolved\n#     hostnames to be written to Zope's access log. By default, Zope will\n#     not resolve hostnames unless this is set.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    dns-server 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: ip-address\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol\n#     implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope\n#     will listen on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This\n#     directive can be overridden on a per-server basis in the servers\n#     section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    ip-address 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: http-realm\n#\n# Description:\n#     The HTTP \"Realm\" header value sent by this Zope instance. This value\n#     often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.\n#\n# Default: Zope\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    http-realm Slipknot\n\n\n# Directive: cgi-maxlen\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this value to limit the amount of form data being processed\n#     by Zope to prevent DoS attacks.\n#\n# Default: 0 (= no restrictions)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    cgi-maxlen 10000\n\n\n# Directive: http-header-max-length\n#\n# Description:\n#     Maximum number of bytes allowed within a HTTP request header. The request\n#     is discarded and considered as a DoS attack if the header size exceeds\n#     this limit.\n#\n# Default: 8192\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     http-header-max-length 16384\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-author-via\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the \"MS-Author-Via\" header\n#     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '<'\n#     when used in <dtml-var> construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '<' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a <dtml-var> or &dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - > Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\nsession-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper access rule.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-access-rules on\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-site-roots\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no site roots in your Zope site will\n#     be effective. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper site root.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-site-roots on\n\n\n# Directive: database-quota-size\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to an integer in bytes in order to place a hard\n#     limit on the size which the default FileStorage-backed Zope database\n#     can grow. Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file <instancehome>/log/Z2.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     <instancehome>/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n<eventlog>\n  level info\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event.log\n    level info\n  </logfile>\n</eventlog>\n\n<logger access>\n  level WARN\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2.log\n    format %(message)s\n  </logfile>\n</logger>\n\n# <logger trace>\n#   level WARN\n#   <logfile>\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   </logfile>\n# </logger>\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user. You can specify 'notset' if you don't\n#     want them logged, or use any other logger level (see above).\n#\n# Default: info\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    conflict-error-log-level blather\nconflict-error-log-level debug\n\n\n# Directive: warnfilter\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section that allows you to define a warning filter.\n#     The following keys are valid within a warnfilter section:\n#\n#      action:  one of the following strings:\n#\n#           \"error\"   turn matching warnings into exceptions\n#           \"ignore\"  never print matching warnings\n#           \"always\"  always print matching warnings\n#           \"default\" print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each location where the warning is issued\n#           \"module\"  print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each module where the warning is issued\n#           \"once\"    print only the first occurrence of matching\n#                     warnings, regardless of location\n#\n#      message:  a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                warning message must match (the match is compiled to\n#                always be case-insensitive)\n#\n#      category: a Python dotted-path classname (must be a subclass of\n#                Warning) of which the warning category must be a subclass in\n#                order to match\n#\n#      module:   a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                module name must match (the match is compiled to be\n#                case-sensitive)\n#\n#      lineno:   an integer that the line number where the warning\n#                occurred must match, or 0 to match all line numbers\n#\n#     All keys within a warnfilter section are optional.

For example, if the http-server port is 8080 and\n#     the port-base is 1000, the HTTP server will listen on port 9080.\n#     This makes it easy to change the complete set of ports used by a\n#     Zope server process\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     0\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     port-base 1000\n\n\n# Directive: large-file-threshold\n#\n# Description:\n#     Requests bigger than this size get saved into a temporary file\n#     instead of being read completely into memory.\n#\n# Default: 512K\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    large-file-threshold 1Mb\n\n# Directive: default-zpublisher-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#     This controls what character set is used to encode unicode\n#     data that reaches ZPublisher without any other specified encoding.\n#\n# Default: iso-8859-15\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    default-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directives: servers\n#\n# Description:\n#     A set of sections which allow the specification of Zope's various\n#     ZServer servers.  8 different server types may be defined:\n#     http-server, ftp-server, webdav-source-server, persistent-cgi,\n#     fast-cgi, monitor-server, icp-server, and clock-server.  If no servers\n#     are defined, the default servers are used.\n#\n#     Ports may be specified using the 'address' directive either in simple\n#     form (80) or in complex form including hostname 127.0.0.1:80.  If the\n#     hostname is \"left off\", the default-ip-address is used as the hostname.\n#\n#     Port numbers are offset by the setting of port-base.\n#\n#     To run the monitor-server an emergency user must be defined\n#     (through an 'access' file).\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     An HTTP server starts on port 8080.\n\n<http-server>\n  # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n  address 9080\n\n  # force-connection-close on\n  #\n  # You can also use the WSGI interface between ZServer and ZPublisher:\n  # use-wsgi on\n  #\n  # To defer the opening of the HTTP socket until the end of the\n  # startup phase:\n  # fast-listen off\n</http-server>\n\n# Examples:\n#\n#  <ftp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 8021\n#  </ftp-server>\n#\n#  <webdav-source-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n#    address 1980\n#    force-connection-close off\n#  </webdav-source-server>\n#\n#  <persistent-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"path\"\n#    path somefile\n#  </persistent-cgi>\n#\n#  <fast-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"; the address may be hostname:port, port,\n#    # or a path for a Unix-domain socket\n#    address somefile\n#  </fast-cgi>\n#\n#  <monitor-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\"\n#    address 8099\n#  </monitor-server>\n#\n#  <icp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 888\n#  </icp-server>\n#\n#  <clock-server>\n#    # starts a clock which calls /foo/bar every 30 seconds\n#    method /foo/bar\n#    period 30\n#    user admin\n#    password 123\n#  </clock-server>\n\n# Database (zodb_db) section\n#\n# Description:\n#     A database section allows the definition of custom database and\n#     storage types.

To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <environment>\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    </environment>\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    debug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.  This file is used by zopectl.py to determine if Zope is\n#     currently running.  This defaults to CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    lock-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.lock\n\n\n# Directive: mime-types\n#\n# Description:\n#     Tells Zope about additional mime.types files that should be\n#     loaded.  The files have the same format as the mime.types file\n#     distributed with Apache.  The \"mime-types\" setting may be given\n#     more than once in the configuration file.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     mime-types  $INSTANCE/etc/mime.types\n\n\n# Directive: structured-text-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for structured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    structured-text-header-level 1\n\n# Directive: rest-input-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the input encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-input-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-output-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the output encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).

This is useful\n#     when you want to proxy requests from another web server to Zserver,\n#     and would like Zserver's CGI environment to reflect the CGI\n#     environment of the other web server.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# <cgi-environment>\n#   HTTPS_SERVER Foobar Server 1.0\n#   HTTPS_PORT 443\n# </cgi-environment>\n\n<cgi-environment>\n  HTTPS ON\n</cgi-environment>\n\n\n# Directive: dns-server\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the IP address of your DNS server in order to cause resolved\n#     hostnames to be written to Zope's access log. By default, Zope will\n#     not resolve hostnames unless this is set.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    dns-server 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: ip-address\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol\n#     implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope\n#     will listen on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This\n#     directive can be overridden on a per-server basis in the servers\n#     section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    ip-address 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: http-realm\n#\n# Description:\n#     The HTTP \"Realm\" header value sent by this Zope instance. This value\n#     often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.\n#\n# Default: Zope\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    http-realm Slipknot\n\n\n# Directive: cgi-maxlen\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this value to limit the amount of form data being processed\n#     by Zope to prevent DoS attacks.\n#\n# Default: 0 (= no restrictions)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    cgi-maxlen 10000\n\n\n# Directive: http-header-max-length\n#\n# Description:\n#     Maximum number of bytes allowed within a HTTP request header. The request\n#     is discarded and considered as a DoS attack if the header size exceeds\n#     this limit.\n#\n# Default: 8192\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     http-header-max-length 16384\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-author-via\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the \"MS-Author-Via\" header\n#     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '<'\n#     when used in <dtml-var> construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '<' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a <dtml-var> or &dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - > Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\nsession-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper access rule.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-access-rules on\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-site-roots\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no site roots in your Zope site will\n#     be effective. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper site root.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-site-roots on\n\n\n# Directive: database-quota-size\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to an integer in bytes in order to place a hard\n#     limit on the size which the default FileStorage-backed Zope database\n#     can grow. Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file <instancehome>/log/Z2.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     <instancehome>/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n<eventlog>\n  level info\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event.log\n    level info\n  </logfile>\n</eventlog>\n\n<logger access>\n  level WARN\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2.log\n    format %(message)s\n  </logfile>\n</logger>\n\n# <logger trace>\n#   level WARN\n#   <logfile>\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   </logfile>\n# </logger>\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user. You can specify 'notset' if you don't\n#     want them logged, or use any other logger level (see above).\n#\n# Default: info\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    conflict-error-log-level blather\nconflict-error-log-level debug\n\n\n# Directive: warnfilter\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section that allows you to define a warning filter.\n#     The following keys are valid within a warnfilter section:\n#\n#      action:  one of the following strings:\n#\n#           \"error\"   turn matching warnings into exceptions\n#           \"ignore\"  never print matching warnings\n#           \"always\"  always print matching warnings\n#           \"default\" print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each location where the warning is issued\n#           \"module\"  print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each module where the warning is issued\n#           \"once\"    print only the first occurrence of matching\n#                     warnings, regardless of location\n#\n#      message:  a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                warning message must match (the match is compiled to\n#                always be case-insensitive)\n#\n#      category: a Python dotted-path classname (must be a subclass of\n#                Warning) of which the warning category must be a subclass in\n#                order to match\n#\n#      module:   a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                module name must match (the match is compiled to be\n#                case-sensitive)\n#\n#      lineno:   an integer that the line number where the warning\n#                occurred must match, or 0 to match all line numbers\n#\n#     All keys within a warnfilter section are optional.

If the\n#     hostname is \"left off\", the default-ip-address is used as the hostname.\n#\n#     Port numbers are offset by the setting of port-base.\n#\n#     To run the monitor-server an emergency user must be defined\n#     (through an 'access' file).\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     An HTTP server starts on port 8080.\n\n<http-server>\n  # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n  address 9320\n\n  # force-connection-close on\n  #\n  # You can also use the WSGI interface between ZServer and ZPublisher:\n  # use-wsgi on\n  #\n  # To defer the opening of the HTTP socket until the end of the\n  # startup phase:\n  # fast-listen off\n</http-server>\n\n# Examples:\n#\n#  <ftp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 8021\n#  </ftp-server>\n#\n#  <webdav-source-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\" and \"force-connection-close\"\n#    address 1980\n#    force-connection-close off\n#  </webdav-source-server>\n#\n#  <persistent-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"path\"\n#    path somefile\n#  </persistent-cgi>\n#\n#  <fast-cgi>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"; the address may be hostname:port, port,\n#    # or a path for a Unix-domain socket\n#    address somefile\n#  </fast-cgi>\n#\n#  <monitor-server>\n#    # valid keys are \"address\"\n#    address 8099\n#  </monitor-server>\n#\n#  <icp-server>\n#    # valid key is \"address\"\n#    address 888\n#  </icp-server>\n#\n#  <clock-server>\n#    # starts a clock which calls /foo/bar every 30 seconds\n#    method /foo/bar\n#    period 30\n#    user admin\n#    password 123\n#  </clock-server>\n\n# Database (zodb_db) section\n#\n# Description:\n#     A database section allows the definition of custom database and\n#     storage types.

The Zope configuration file\n# shows what the default configuration directives are, and show\n# examples for each directive.  To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    <environment>\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    </environment>\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    debug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.  This file is used by zopectl.py to determine if Zope is\n#     currently running.  This defaults to CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    lock-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.lock\n\n\n# Directive: mime-types\n#\n# Description:\n#     Tells Zope about additional mime.types files that should be\n#     loaded.  The files have the same format as the mime.types file\n#     distributed with Apache.  The \"mime-types\" setting may be given\n#     more than once in the configuration file.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     mime-types  $INSTANCE/etc/mime.types\n\n\n# Directive: structured-text-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for structured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    structured-text-header-level 1\n\n# Directive: rest-input-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the input encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-input-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-output-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the output encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-output-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for restructured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an <H3> tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-header-level 2\n\n# Directive: rest-language-code\n#\n# Description:\n#    Language code used for some internal translations inside of the docutils\n#    package and for DTD bibliographic elements mapping. See\n#    lib/python/docutils/languages/ for a list of supported language codes.\n#\n# Default: en\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-language-code de\n\n# Directive: cgi-environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which allows a user to define arbitrary key-value pairs for\n#     use as the initial CGI environment variables. This is useful\n#     when you want to proxy requests from another web server to Zserver,\n#     and would like Zserver's CGI environment to reflect the CGI\n#     environment of the other web server.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# <cgi-environment>\n#   HTTPS_SERVER Foobar Server 1.0\n#   HTTPS_PORT 443\n# </cgi-environment>\n\n<cgi-environment>\n  HTTPS ON\n</cgi-environment>\n\n\n# Directive: dns-server\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the IP address of your DNS server in order to cause resolved\n#     hostnames to be written to Zope's access log. By default, Zope will\n#     not resolve hostnames unless this is set.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    dns-server 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: ip-address\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol\n#     implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope\n#     will listen on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This\n#     directive can be overridden on a per-server basis in the servers\n#     section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    ip-address 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: http-realm\n#\n# Description:\n#     The HTTP \"Realm\" header value sent by this Zope instance. This value\n#     often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.\n#\n# Default: Zope\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    http-realm Slipknot\n\n\n# Directive: cgi-maxlen\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this value to limit the amount of form data being processed\n#     by Zope to prevent DoS attacks.\n#\n# Default: 0 (= no restrictions)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    cgi-maxlen 10000\n\n\n# Directive: http-header-max-length\n#\n# Description:\n#     Maximum number of bytes allowed within a HTTP request header. The request\n#     is discarded and considered as a DoS attack if the header size exceeds\n#     this limit.\n#\n# Default: 8192\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     http-header-max-length 16384\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-author-via\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the \"MS-Author-Via\" header\n#     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '<'\n#     when used in <dtml-var> construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '<' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a <dtml-var> or &dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - > Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\nsession-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper access rule.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-access-rules on\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-site-roots\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no site roots in your Zope site will\n#     be effective. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper site root.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-site-roots on\n\n\n# Directive: database-quota-size\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to an integer in bytes in order to place a hard\n#     limit on the size which the default FileStorage-backed Zope database\n#     can grow. Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file <instancehome>/log/Z2.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     <instancehome>/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n<eventlog>\n  level info\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event.log\n    level info\n  </logfile>\n</eventlog>\n\n<logger access>\n  level WARN\n  <logfile>\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2.log\n    format %(message)s\n  </logfile>\n</logger>\n\n# <logger trace>\n#   level WARN\n#   <logfile>\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   </logfile>\n# </logger>\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user.
