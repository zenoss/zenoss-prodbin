"""This is a backport of shutil.get_terminal_size from Python 3.3.

The original implementation is in C, but here we use the ctypes and
fcntl modules to create a pure Python version of os.get_terminal_size.

    For each of the two dimensions, the environment variable, COLUMNS

    the value is a positive integer, it is used.

    When COLUMNS or LINES is not defined, which is the common case,
    the terminal connected to sys.__stdout__ is queried
    by invoking os.get_terminal_size.

    If the terminal size cannot be successfully queried, either because
    the system doesn't support querying, or because we are not
    connected to a terminal, the value given in fallback parameter
    is used. Fallback defaults to (80, 24) which is the default
    size used by many terminal emulators.

    The value returned is a named tuple of type os.terminal_size.
