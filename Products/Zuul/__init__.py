"""
The Zuul module presents two APIs. One is an internal Python API and the other
is a remote JSON API.  The code that presents the JSON API is built on top of
the Python API. The Python API can be used to extend Zenoss with code that
runs within zopectl, zenhub, or zendmd. The Python API is made up of multiple
facades representing the various aspects of the Zenoss domain model. Each
facade supplies methods that allow the user to retrieve and manipulate
information stored in the Zope object database, the MySQL database, and the
RRDtool data files.  The facades return simple info objects (similar to Java
beans) that primarily contain a set of properties. Each info object adapts a
particular class from the ZenModel module.

The JSON API adheres to the Ext Direct protocol
(http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/extdirect). The Ext JS library makes it
very easy to work with this protocol, but the data format is simple and it
could be easily consumed within other javascript frameworks or clients written
in any language that has a JSON library.  The JSON API is implented by
multiple routers, which for the most part, map one-to-one with the Python API
facades.  The routers use the marshalling module included in Zuul to transform
the info objects returned by the facade into a Python data structure can be
dumped to a JSON formatted string by the Python json module. The marshalling
module also provides the capability of binding the values in a Python data
structure loaded by the Python json module to the properties of a Zuul info
object.
