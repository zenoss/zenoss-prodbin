The Zope configuration file\n# shows what the default configuration directives are, and show\n# examples for each directive.  To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    \u003cenvironment\u003e\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    \u003c/environment\u003e\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    debug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.  This file is used by zopectl.py to determine if Zope is\n#     currently running.  This defaults to CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.lock\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    lock-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.lock\n\n\n# Directive: mime-types\n#\n# Description:\n#     Tells Zope about additional mime.types files that should be\n#     loaded.  The files have the same format as the mime.types file\n#     distributed with Apache.  The \"mime-types\" setting may be given\n#     more than once in the configuration file.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     mime-types  $INSTANCE/etc/mime.types\n\n\n# Directive: structured-text-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for structured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an \u003cH3\u003e tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    structured-text-header-level 1\n\n# Directive: rest-input-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the input encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-input-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-output-encoding\n#\n# Description:\n#    Specifies the output encoding of re-StructuredText documents\n#    (e.g. 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-15' or any other valid encoding recognized\n#    by Python).  The default is your Python's default encoding.\n#\n# Default: unset (uses system default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-output-encoding iso-8859-15\n\n# Directive: rest-header-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set the default starting HTML header level for restructured text\n#     documents. The default is 3, which implies that top-level headers\n#     will be created with an \u003cH3\u003e tag.\n#\n# Default: 3\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-header-level 2\n\n# Directive: rest-language-code\n#\n# Description:\n#    Language code used for some internal translations inside of the docutils\n#    package and for DTD bibliographic elements mapping. See\n#    lib/python/docutils/languages/ for a list of supported language codes.\n#\n# Default: en\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    rest-language-code de\n\n# Directive: cgi-environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which allows a user to define arbitrary key-value pairs for\n#     use as the initial CGI environment variables. This is useful\n#     when you want to proxy requests from another web server to Zserver,\n#     and would like Zserver's CGI environment to reflect the CGI\n#     environment of the other web server.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# \u003ccgi-environment\u003e\n#   HTTPS_SERVER Foobar Server 1.0\n#   HTTPS_PORT 443\n# \u003c/cgi-environment\u003e\n\n\u003ccgi-environment\u003e\n  HTTPS ON\n\u003c/cgi-environment\u003e\n\n\n# Directive: dns-server\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the IP address of your DNS server in order to cause resolved\n#     hostnames to be written to Zope's access log. By default, Zope will\n#     not resolve hostnames unless this is set.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    dns-server 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: ip-address\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default IP address on which Zope's various server protocol\n#     implementations will listen for requests. If this is unset, Zope\n#     will listen on all IP addresses supported by the machine. This\n#     directive can be overridden on a per-server basis in the servers\n#     section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    ip-address 127.0.0.1\n\n\n# Directive: http-realm\n#\n# Description:\n#     The HTTP \"Realm\" header value sent by this Zope instance. This value\n#     often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.\n#\n# Default: Zope\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    http-realm Slipknot\n\n\n# Directive: cgi-maxlen\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this value to limit the amount of form data being processed\n#     by Zope to prevent DoS attacks.\n#\n# Default: 0 (= no restrictions)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    cgi-maxlen 10000\n\n\n# Directive: http-header-max-length\n#\n# Description:\n#     Maximum number of bytes allowed within a HTTP request header. The request\n#     is discarded and considered as a DoS attack if the header size exceeds\n#     this limit.\n#\n# Default: 8192\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#     http-header-max-length 16384\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-author-via\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the \"MS-Author-Via\" header\n#     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of\n#     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack\n#     your site, so be careful when turning it on.\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the\n#     OPTIONS WebDAV request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-public-header on\n\n# Directive: automatically-quote-dtml-request-data\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of\n#     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '\u003c'\n#     when used in \u003cdtml-var\u003e construction. When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '\u003c' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a \u003cdtml-var\u003e or \u0026dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - \u003e Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\nsession-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper access rule.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-access-rules on\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-site-roots\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no site roots in your Zope site will\n#     be effective. This is useful if you \"lock yourself out\" of a\n#     particular part of your site by setting an improper site root.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    suppress-all-site-roots on\n\n\n# Directive: database-quota-size\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to an integer in bytes in order to place a hard\n#     limit on the size which the default FileStorage-backed Zope database\n#     can grow. Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.  XXXX much more detail necessary here\n#\n# Default:\n#\n#     The access log will log to the file \u003cinstancehome\u003e/log/Z2.log at\n#     level INFO, the event log will log to the file\n#     \u003cinstancehome\u003e/log/event.log at level INFO, and the trace log\n#     will not be written anywhere.\n\n\u003ceventlog\u003e\n  level info\n  \u003clogfile\u003e\n    path $INSTANCE/log/event.log\n    level info\n  \u003c/logfile\u003e\n\u003c/eventlog\u003e\n\n\u003clogger access\u003e\n  level WARN\n  \u003clogfile\u003e\n    path $INSTANCE/log/Z2.log\n    format %(message)s\n  \u003c/logfile\u003e\n\u003c/logger\u003e\n\n# \u003clogger trace\u003e\n#   level WARN\n#   \u003clogfile\u003e\n#     path $INSTANCE/log/trace.log\n#     format %(message)s\n#   \u003c/logfile\u003e\n# \u003c/logger\u003e\n\n\n# Directive: conflict-error-log-level\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specifies at which level conflict errors are logged. Conflict\n#     errors, when occuring in small numbers, are a normal part of the\n#     Zope optimistic transaction conflict resolution algorithms. They\n#     are retried automatically a few times, and are therefore usually\n#     not visible by the user. You can specify 'notset' if you don't\n#     want them logged, or use any other logger level (see above).\n#\n# Default: info\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    conflict-error-log-level blather\nconflict-error-log-level debug\n\n\n# Directive: warnfilter\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section that allows you to define a warning filter.\n#     The following keys are valid within a warnfilter section:\n#\n#      action:  one of the following strings:\n#\n#           \"error\"   turn matching warnings into exceptions\n#           \"ignore\"  never print matching warnings\n#           \"always\"  always print matching warnings\n#           \"default\" print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each location where the warning is issued\n#           \"module\"  print the first occurrence of matching warnings\n#                     for each module where the warning is issued\n#           \"once\"    print only the first occurrence of matching\n#                     warnings, regardless of location\n#\n#      message:  a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                warning message must match (the match is compiled to\n#                always be case-insensitive)\n#\n#      category: a Python dotted-path classname (must be a subclass of\n#                Warning) of which the warning category must be a subclass in\n#                order to match\n#\n#      module:   a string containing a regular expression that the\n#                module name must match (the match is compiled to be\n#                case-sensitive)\n#\n#      lineno:   an integer that the line number where the warning\n#                occurred must match, or 0 to match all line numbers\n#\n#     All keys within a warnfilter section are optional.

The Zope configuration file\n# shows what the default configuration directives are, and show\n# examples for each directive.  To declare a directive, make sure that\n# you add it to a line that does not begin with '#'.  Note that comments\n# are only allowed at the beginning of a line: you may not add comments\n# after directive text on the same line.\n#\n# Note for Developers\n# ===================\n#\n# This file is *not* auto-generated. If you create a new directive you\n# very likely want to include an example of how to use the new\n# directive in this file.\n#\n# You shouldn't modify 'zope.conf.in' to change\n# configuration. Instead, you should make a copy into 'zope.conf' and\n# modify that to avoid checking in changes to this file by mistake.\n\n# ZConfig \"defines\" used for later textual substitution\n\n%define INSTANCE /opt/zenoss\n\n# this needs to match the encoding in the sitecustomize.py file\n# in $ZENHOME/lib/python\ndefault-zpublisher-encoding utf-8\n\n# Directive: instancehome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the data files, local product files, import directory,\n#     and Extensions directory used by Zope.\n#\n# Required (no default)\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    instancehome /home/chrism/projects/sessions\n\ninstancehome $INSTANCE\n\n# Directive: clienthome\n#\n# Description:\n#     The directory in which a running Zope's process identifier files are\n#     placed.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/var\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    clienthome /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var\n\n\n# Directive: path\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory which should be inserted into the\n#     the beginning of Python's module search path.  This directive\n#     may be specified as many times as needed to insert additional\n#     directories.  The set of directories specified is inserted into the\n#     beginning of the module search path in the order which they are specified\n#     here.  Note that the processing of this directive may happen too late\n#     under some circumstances; it is recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH\n#     environment variable if using this directive doesn't work for you.\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/lib/python\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    path $INSTANCE/mypymodules\n\n\n# Directive: products\n#\n# Description:\n#     Name of a directory that contains additional Product packages.  This\n#     directive may be used as many times as needed to add additional\n#     collections of products.  Each directory identified will be\n#     added to the __path__ of the Products package.  All Products are\n#     initialized in ascending alphabetical order by product name.  If\n#     two products with the same name exist in two Products directories,\n#     the order in which the packages appear here defines the load\n#     order.  The master Products directory exists in Zope's software home,\n#     and cannot be removed from the products path (and should not be added\n#     to it here).\n#\n# Default: $INSTANCE/Products\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    products /home/chrism/projects/myproducts\n\n\n# Directive: environment\n#\n# Description:\n#     A section which can be used to define arbitrary key-value pairs\n#     for use as environment variables during Zope's run cycle.  It\n#     is not recommended to set system-related environment variables such as\n#     PYTHONPATH within this section.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    \u003cenvironment\u003e\n#      MY_PRODUCT_ENVVAR foobar\n#    \u003c/environment\u003e\n\n# Directive: debug-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for\n#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:\n#\n#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal\n#\n#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail\n#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).\n#\n#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and\n#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server\n#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is\n#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.\n#\n#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is\n#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    debug-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: effective-user\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you intend to run Zope as the \"root\" user, you must supply this\n#     directive with an effective username or userid number to which Zope\n#     will 'suid' after the server ports are bound. This directive only\n#     has effect under UNIX and if Zope is started as the root user.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\neffective-user zenoss\n\n\n# Directive: enable-product-installation\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is turned on, Zope performs 'product installation'\n#     (the registration of Python modules in various Products directories)\n#     at startup. Turning this off can speed Zope/ZEO startup time,\n#     but it can also cause your Control_Panel Product list to become\n#     desynchronized with the contents of your Products\n#     directories.  NOTE: Zope *must* be started at least once with\n#     this directive set to \"on\" or you will receive an error.  If using ZEO,\n#     at least one ZEO client must be run with this directive set to \"on\"\n#     once, the others can have it turned off.\n#     NOTE: If your main storage is mounted read-only,\n#     you must set this directive to \"off\".\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\nenable-product-installation off\n\n# Directive: locale\n#\n# Description:\n#     Enable locale (internationalization) support by supplying a locale\n#     name to be used. See your operating system documentation for locale\n#     information specific to your system. If your Python module does not\n#     support the locale module, or if the requested locale is not\n#     supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not\n#     start.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    locale fr_FR\n\n\n# Directive: datetime-format\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this variable either to \"us\" or \"international\" to force the\n#     DateTime module to parse date strings either with\n#     month-before-days-before-year (\"us\") or\n#     days-before-month-before-year (\"international\").  The default\n#     behaviour of DateTime (when this setting is left unset) is to\n#     parse dates as US dates.\n#\n# Default: us\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    datetime-format international\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-threads\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify the number of threads that Zope's ZServer web server will use\n#     to service requests. The default is 4.\n#\n# Default: 4\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-threads 10\n\n\n# Directive: python-check-interval\n#\n# Description:\n#     Specify an integer representing the Python interpreter \"check\n#     interval\" This interval determines how often the interpreter checks\n#     for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers. The\n#     Zope default is 500, but you may want to experiment with other values\n#     in order to attempt to increae performance in your particular\n#     environment.\n#\n# Default: 500\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    python-check-interval 1000\n\n\n# Directive: zserver-read-only-mode\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to 'on', it will cause Zope to inhibit the\n#     creation of log files and pid files. Access and event log files will\n#     be presented on standard output. Setting this directive 'on' causes\n#     pcgi, fastcgi, and daemon-related directives to have no effect.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zserver-read-only-mode on\n\n\n# Directive: pid-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to the file in which the Zope process id(s) will be written.\n#     This defaults to client-home/Z2.pid.\n#\n# Default: CLIENT_HOME/Z2.pid\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    pid-filename /home/chrism/projects/sessions/var/Z2.pid\n\n\n# Directive: lock-filename\n#\n# Description:\n#     The path to a \"lock file\" which will be locked by Zope while it's\n#     running.  This file is used by zopectl.py to determine if Zope is\n#     currently running.

Early versions of\n#     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to\n#     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.\n#\n#     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant\n#     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office\n#     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit\n#     them and is only trying to download them.\n#\n#     Check this collector entry for more information:\n#     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441\n#\n#     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January\n#     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a\n#     \"Public\" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV\n#     request.\n#     (http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/webfolders-zope)\n#\n#     To get a recent Microsoft Web Folders implementation, refer to\n#     Microsoft KB Article 907306.\n#     (Software Update for Web Folders: May 18, 2007).\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    enable-ms-author-via on\n\n# Directive: enable-ms-public-header\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the \"Public\" header\n#     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.\n#\n#     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original\n#     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few\n#     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most\n#     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.\n#\n#     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention\n#     turning off this header with the subject of \"Mask Your Web Server\n#     For Enhanced Security\", this setting is off by\n#     default.

When this directive is 'on',\n#     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to\n#     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '\u003c' will be\n#     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a \u003cdtml-var\u003e or \u0026dtml- construct. This\n#     mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will leave their\n#     sites open to a \"client-side trojan\" attack.\n#\n# Default: on\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    automatically-quote-dtml-request-data on\n\n# Directive: trusted-proxy\n#\n# Description:\n#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a\n#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list\n#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate\n#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from\n#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain\n#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based\n#     authentication restriction.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    trusted-proxy www.example.com\n#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1\n\n# Directive: publisher-profile-file\n#\n# Description:\n#    Names a file on the filesystem which causes Zope's Python\n#    profiling capabilities to be enabled.  For more information, see\n#    the Debug Information - \u003e Profiling tab of Zope's Control_Panel\n#    via the Zope Management Interface.  IMPORTANT: setting this\n#    filename will cause Zope code to be executed much more slowly\n#    than normal.  This should not be enabled in production.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    publisher-profile-file $INSTANCE/var/profile.dat\n\n\n# Directive: security-policy-implementation\n#\n# Description:\n#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change\n#     this to \"python\" to use the Python version of the Zope security\n#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful\n#     for debugging purposes.  See also the \"verbose-security\" option\n#     below.\n#\n# Default: C\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n\n# Directive: skip-authentication-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related\n#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.\n#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-authentication-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: skip-ownership-checking\n#\n# Description:\n#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking\n#     when attempting to execute \"through the web\" code. By default, this\n#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems\n#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more\n#     privilege to execute dangerous code.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    skip-ownership-checking on\n\n\n# Directive: verbose-security\n#\n# Description:\n#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in\n#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option\n#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about\n#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.\n#     If you enable this option, you must also set the\n#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.\n#\n# Default: off\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    security-policy-implementation python\n#    verbose-security on\n\n\n# Directive: maximum-number-of-session-objects\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of items to use as a\n#     \"maximum number of subobjects\" value of the\n#     '/temp_folder/session_data' transient object container.\n#\n# Default: 1000\n#\n# Example:\n#\nmaximum-number-of-session-objects 100000\n\n\n# Directive: session-add-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object addition\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-add-notify-script-path /scripts/add_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-delete-notify-script-path\n#\n# Description:\n#     An optional fill Zope path name of a callable object to be set as the\n#     \"script to call on object deletion\" of the sessioN_data transient\n#     object container created in the /temp_folder folder at startup.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-delete-notify-script-path /scripts/del_notifier\n\n\n# Directive: session-timeout-minutes\n#\n# Description:\n#     An integer value representing the number of minutes to be used as the\n#     \"data object timeout\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#     object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    session-timeout-minutes 30\n\n\n# Directive: session-resolution-seconds\n#\n# Description:\n#    An integer value representing the number of seconds to be used as the\n#    \"timeout resolution\" of the '/temp_folder/session_data' transient\n#    object container.\n#\n# Default: 20\n#\n# Example:\n#\nsession-resolution-seconds 60\n\n\n# Directive: suppress-all-access-rules\n#\n# Description:\n#     If this directive is set to on, no access rules in your Zope site\n#     will be executed.

Additions to the database will not be permitted once this\n#     filesize is exceeded.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    database-quota-size 1000000\n\n\n# Directive: zeo-client-name\n#\n# Description:\n#     If you want a persistent ZEO client cache which retains cache\n#     contents across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define a\n#     zeo-client-name.  If you use ZEO and you don't set a\n#     zeo-client-name, the client cache is stored in temporary files\n#     which are removed when the ClientStorage shuts down.  The value\n#     of zeo-client-name is used to uniquely identify the local cache\n#     files created if this Zope is a ZEO client.\n#\n# Default: unset\n#\n# Example:\n#\n#    zeo-client-name zeo1\n\n\n# Directives: logger\n#\n# Description:\n#     This area should define one or more \"logger\" sections of the\n#     names \"access\", \"event\", and \"trace\".  The \"access\" logger logs\n#     Zope server access.  The \"event\" logger logs Zope event\n#     information.  The \"trace\" logger logs detailed server request\n#     information (for debugging purposes only).  Each logger section\n#     may contain a \"level\" name/value pair which indicates the level\n#     of logging detail to capture for this logger.  The default level\n#     is INFO.  Level may be any of \"CRITICAL\", 'ERROR\", WARN\", \"INFO\",\n#     \"DEBUG\", and \"ALL\".  Each logger section may additionally contain\n#     one or more \"handler\" sections which indicates a types of log\n#     \"handlers\" (file, syslog, NT event log, etc) to be used for the\n#     logger being defined.  There are 5 types of handlers: logfile,\n#     syslog, win32-eventlog, http-handler, email-notifier.  Each\n#     handler type has its own set of allowable subkeys which define\n#     aspects of the handler.  All handler sections also allow for the\n#     specification of a \"format\" (the log message format string), a\n#     \"dateformat\" (the log message format for date strings), and a\n#     \"level\", which has the same semantics of the overall logger\n#     level but overrides the logger's level for the handler it's\n#     defined upon.
