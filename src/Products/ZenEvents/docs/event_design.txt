Event Design
==========================


Event objects need to be persisted in the mysql database.

On queries from within zope they must use the zope security stuff to allow
controled access to there data.

They must be constructable out side of a zope frame work as well.

To meet these requirements there needs to be three types of event:

1. Event - event that lives outsize of zope context and can go into/outof mysql.
2. ZEvent - event in zope context inherits from Event has subset of fields
        populated as defined by resultFields in a getEventList query.
3. ZEventDetail - full event information (allfields, detail, and log)
